To set up this shell-based web server, you just install several helpers.
This script downloads and builds most of those helpers.  To build the
helpers, type

        make
        sudo make install

This does not install the shell-based web server in any way.

Before you run the server:

1.  Install php-cgi if desired.  This could not be scripted due to the way
    the PHP website is designed.  To install this, do the following:

    a.  Download and extract the PHP soruces,
    b.  cd into the resulting source directory.
    c.  Type

            ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php5-cgi --with-zlib \
        	--enable-cgi --enable-force-cgi-redirect=false

        and press return.  (You can add additional flags if desired.)
    d.  Type "make ; sudo make intall" and press return.

2.  Adjust the configuration file.

    Modify the file shttpd.conf in the shttpd directory as needed for your
    local environment.

3.  Add symbolic links in the sites directory.

    Each combination of host name (or IP number) and port that you
    want to actually serve must have a folder or symbolic link to a
    folder within the sites directory.  This design greatly simplifies
    the configuration file format.


Now you're ready to run the server.  Change back into the shttp directory
and type:

    ./shttps.sh

Now connect to localhost:8081 and have fun.
