Description:
 - Allows you to load custom mods for Modern Warfare 2
 - Loads from raw .gsc script files instead of having to create a new .ff file

 Note: it is recommended to use a VAC disabler such as VAC Chaos in conjunction with this program.
       Again, by using this program, you have agreed not to blame the author of this program for any
       consequences that may arise from using this program.

 - A modern Windows-NT based operating system (XP and above). Both x86 and x64 are supported.

How to use:
-----------
 - Open "LoaderX.exe" as administrator (for Vista and Windows 7)
 - Click "Auto-Inject". Make sure it says "Searching for..."
   if it says "An error occured", log off and log back on Windows
 - Open MW2_Modder.ini and configure as necessary
 - Run Modern Warfare 2 (through VAC Chaos if you're using it)
 - Host a game (either private match, or public ranked match through VAC Chaos)
 - Enjoy your mod!

Tip: If you are creating a new mod, refer to many guides created by the XBOX modding community; they're helpful.
     Use a program like ffViewer to extract the game's stock .gsc files from the .ff files, and go from there.
     The "mod folder" goes in the same folder as MW2_Modder.dll, and the name is the name of your mod. You then
     simply follow the same directory structure as the .gsc files were in the .ff file. See the included 'scoutzknivez'
     mod for an example.
