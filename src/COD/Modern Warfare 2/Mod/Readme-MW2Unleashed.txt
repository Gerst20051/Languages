Tested on:
-----------
	Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Multiplayer v1.0
	Microsoft(R) Windows Vista Ultimate x64 SP2


Description:
------------
	Tired of Infinity Ward locking down the PC version of MW2? No problem!
	This program will allow you to bring back the globally loved
	developer console in the game! Plus, it will unlock important cvars like
	cg_fov to change the field-of-view at the same time!

	I hope with the release of this program, Infinity Ward will un-neuter
	Modern Warfare 2 officially.

	NOTE: By using this program, you agree that any consequences of usage
	      shall not be imposed on the programmer (AgentGOD). Use at your
	      own will and risk! I, the programmer, will NOT be held responsible
	      in the event that you are banned by VAC.

	With that in mind, the program should NOT trigger a VAC-ban, but I cannot
	make any guarantees.

Usage:
------
	Run LoaderX.exe.
	Click Auto-Inject.
	Launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Single/Multiplayer.
	Enjoy the tilde (~) key in its full glory.
