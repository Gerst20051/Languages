In-game hotkeys:
 F1 - Toggle draw fps and current host
 F2 - Open developer console
 F3 - Team-kill exploit tool - Join a game, make sure the other team has at least one spot left,
			       Press hotkey, click on the enemy team, choose class, kill the green guys.
			       Because this exploit requires at least one spot, it is recommended to do it
			       at the beginning of a game when people are still joining.

			       For "spec-nading", go into any game, go near teammate with claymore/grenade,
			       place claymore/grenade near teammate, press hotkey, Spectator. Watch it blow them up.
			       Press the hotkey again and "auto assign" to re-join your team.
 F4 - Host a public ranked match with custom settings - Go to "Find Game", choose your favorite game type,
							and then hit the hotkey. Customize the settings however
							you'd like, and then hit F5 to start the game when ready.
						
						Note: MAKE SURE that you hit hotkey BEFORE the game joins a lobby.
 F5 - Start the game (when using F4 to force-host)

How to use:
 - Launch Steam and login to your account with Modern Warfare 2 on it
 - Open VAC_Chaos.exe as administrator (*Windows XP users: just make sure you run under an administrator account)
 - Change the configurations however you would like
 - Click Load Game when you're ready to play
 - Make sure it says "VAC status: Not Loaded", or else do not load any hacks/cheats
   (if it says "VAC status: Loaded" and you ran the game with "Load Game" button, post on forum immediately)
 - Now load up your favorite hacks/cheats and enjoy consequenceless gaming! ;) *
 - You must host a game using the Host Tool to play without getting kicked for not having VAC loaded
   (unless you're lucky enough to join a game hosted by a fellow VAC Chaos user)

To have your custom script file execute on startup (v1.02 minimum), you need to name the file as
 "autoexec.cfg" and the file must be placed inside the Modern Warfare 2 "main" or "players" folder.
 Obviously you'll need to have "Startup script" option checked in the program as well.

* Note: by using this program, you agree that I, the programmer, shall not be in any way responsible for
	anything that happens to your account! You use this and any other program you download from the
	internet at your own risk. With that said, if you exercise caution (e.g. make sure VAC is not loaded),
	you should be completely protected. Watch out for viruses when you look for third party hacks/cheats.

	If you're running Windows Vista or Windows 7, you'll need to run these third party programs as
	administrator as well, unless you have UAC disabled. If you are getting an error about a missing
	.tmp file, that might indicate that your anti-virus software decided to make the program disappear.

	Do not exit VAC Chaos during a game... just don't, unless you want expensive paperweight.

	If you are paranoid about a ban, rename your third party hacks/cheats before using. This program will
	rename itself, so that won't be an issue.

	With that said, good luck, and have fun guys ;) Please donate if you love this program!
