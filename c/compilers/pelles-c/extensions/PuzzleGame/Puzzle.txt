this is a small Boulder puzzle game, not really a Boulder Dash! 
thirty-two maps to play through. 
use the arrow keys to move your hero around the maps. 
you can suck ground or emeralds. 
to do so, just hold down the left control key and press an arrow key 
in the direction where you want to suck. 
with running over an emerald, you will get him likewise. 
you can push stones in two directions, to the left or to the right.
watch the time and let it not run out! 
do not touch the butterfly!  
be careful when the stones are falling!
