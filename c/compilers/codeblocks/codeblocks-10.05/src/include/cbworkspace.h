  * @brief A workspace class.

  * There is always a workspace open. The default one does not contain any projects.\n
  * Currently, no inter-project dependencies are supported but at some point
  * they will be ;)
  *
  * @note The way WorkspaceLoader works now, requires that you save and delete the
  * loaded workspace *before* creating a new one...
