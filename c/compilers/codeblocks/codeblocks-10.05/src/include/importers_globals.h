/**
  * This namespace holds some global flags for project/workspace importers
  * to inter-communicate.\n
  * Basically, workspace importers set/unset these flags so that project
  * importers know how to behave.
  *
  * To explain this a bit further, imagine a MS Visual Studio solution (workspace)
  * file containing 50 projects (yes, I have in mind one!).
  * Without this class, for each project being imported, the user would be asked
  * which compiler to use (one dialog) and which targets to import (another dialog).
  * Imagine the user's frustration having to answer to 100 dialogs (50 x 2)!
  *
  * Using these flags, the workspace importer can notify the project importer
  * what to do, without asking the user each and every import.
  *
  * After the workspace importer is done, it should call the ResetDefaults() function
  * to revert everything to defaults.
