 *
 * <grist> is salt to distinguish between targets that otherwise would
 * have the same name:  it never appears in the bound name of a target.
 * (member) is an archive member name: the syntax is arbitrary, but must

 * On VMS, we keep track of whether the original path was a directory
 * (without a file), so that $(VAR:D) can climb to the parent.
