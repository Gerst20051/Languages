/**
 \page wxSmith
 \section wxsProperties Properties system

    All items inside window resource (and maybe other items in future) are using
 internal wxSmith's properties system. Properties are used for four basic
 purposes:

    \li Integrating with property grid (reading / writing / managing content)
    \li Integrating with xml files using xrc structure (reading / writing)
    \li Integrating with properties streams - streams were designed for wide
        range of actions, mainly reading, writing and correcting data in
        user-defined form
    \li Integrating with quick properties system (this does not depend on
        separate properties but uses whole container)

 Each object using properties system has list of properties objects - classes
 which manage data. Each property object is responsible for first three purposes
 described above. Mainly property object takes one or more variables from
 class and provides procedures operating on them. These prodecures are unified
 and thus operating on properties is identical in all cases, no matter what's
 type of data.

 \subsection wxsPropertyGridManager Property Grid Manager

    There should be one instance of wxsPropertyGridManager widget somewhere in
 system. This is singleton-like class which will be used as main property grid.
 When this class is not provided, properties will work fine, but will be
 generally useless.

 \subsection wxsPropertyContainer Property containers

    Objects using properties must be derived from wxsPropertyContainer class.
 Basically this class provides array of properties objects (wxsProperty*
 classes), and it provides all four groups of actions described at the beginning
 of this page.

    Deriving from wxsPropertyContainer class require defining GetProperties
 method. This method is used to get list of properties associated with this
 class. This function should return static array of wxsProperty* objects
 (properties should be created once for class, not for instalce of class)

   wxsPropertyContainer additionally provides NotifyPropertyChange function
 which is called whenever value of any property is changed. This funcntion may
 be used to refresh other components and to validate property values. When
 value of property is changed inside NotifyPropertyChange, it will be refreshed
 automatically after return.

 Other functions provided in wxsPropertyContainer are:
 \li \link wxsPropertyContainer::ShowInPropertyGrid ShowInPropertyGrid \endlink
        this function is used to select item currently edited in main property
        grid
 \li \link wxsPropertyContainer::NotifyPropertyChange NotifyPropertyChange
        \endlink this function should be called when any of properties is
        changed outside. It is rereading data in property grid, quick properties
        panel and may raise internal notification about property change.
 \li \link wxsPropertyContainer::XmlRead XmlRead \endlink this function reads
        values of all properties from given Xml node
 \li \link wxsPropertyContainer::XmlWrite XmlWrite \endlink this function writes
        values of all properties to given Xml node
 \li \link wxsPropertyContainer::PropStreamRead PropStreamRead \endlink this
        function reads values of all properties from given property stream
        ( \link wxsPropertyContainer::operator>> operator >> \endlink may be
        used instead)
 \li \link wxsPropertyContainer::PropStreamWrite PropStreamWrite \endlink this
        function writes vaues of all properties to given
        property stream ( \link wxsPropertyContainer::operator<< operator <<
        \endlink may be used instead)
 \li \link wxsPropertyContainer::BuildQuickPropertiesPanel
        BuildQuickPropertiesPanel \endlink which creates and associates new
        quick properties panel (described below)


 \subsection wxsPropertyObject property object

    Property objct is object responsible for managing one or more variables in
 class and for providing unified functions operating on it. These functions can
 be divided to three groups (almost same as property container base tasks,
 without support for quick properties):
    \li Functions operating on property grid
        - \link wxsProperty::PGCreate PGCreate \endlink function creating entry
          in property grid and filling it with proper data
        - \link wxsProperty::PGRead PGRead \endlink function reading values from
          property grid and storing them in real variabless
        - \link wxsProperty::PGWrite PGWrite \endlink function updating value
          of property in property grid (reading from real variables and storing
          it inside property grid)
    \li Functions operating on xml data
        - \link wxsProperty::XmlRead XmlRead \endlink function reading value
          from given xml node and storing it inside real variables (or resetting
          values to default ones on read errors)
        - \link wxsProperty::XmlWrite XmlWrite \endlink function writing value
          to given xml node (read from real variable), also see note at the end
          of this subsection
    \li Functions operating on property streams
        - \link wxsProperty::PropStreamRead PropStreamRead \endlink function
          reading value from property stream and storing it inside real
          variables
        - \link wxsProperty::PropStreamWrite PropStreamWrite \endlink function
          writing value of real variabeles to property stream

    Adding new property require defining all those functions in new property
 class. Additionally wxsCutomEditorProperty class may be used. This class
 defines all PG... functions, but other are added:
    \li \link wxsCustomEditorProperty::ShowEditor ShowEditor \endlink inside
        this function, edit dialog should be created and showed in modal. Dialog
        should be destroyed before exiting (in usual case). This function is
        declared public to allow other ithems than property grid to show
        property editor.
    \li \link wxsCustomEditorProperty::GetStr GetStr \endlink this function
        returns string built from property value. This function and
        next ones are not required but may be added to increase property
        functinality.
    \li \link wxsCustomEditorProperty::ParseStr ParseStr \endlink this function
        should parse given string and fetch property value from it. It's not
        required.
    \li \link wxsCustomEditorProperty::CanParseStr CanParseStr \endlink this
        function notifies if this property is able to parse string (if ParseStr
        function has been defined). If yes, user may edit property using
        property editor or by writing string in property grid. This function
        is not required.

    \note Usually when savind data to Xml node, it should not be stored when
        values are equal to default ones. If it's not done in such way, this
        must be nitified in class documentation.

 \subsection wxsQuickPropsPanel Quick Properties Panel

    Quick properties panel is additional editor area where properties can be
 changed. It's purpose is to allow editing most usefull properties in easier
 way than in property grid  and to make the edition more intuitive (very
 standarised threatment in property grid does not leave much place to any kind
 of invention).

    Each property container may have one quick properties editor at one time.
 Panel may be taken using wxsPropertyContainer::BuildQuickPropsPanel function.
 To create panel inside class, OnCreateQuickProperties member function must be
 redeclared and must return pointer to newly created quick properties panel.
 Valid wxsPropertyContainer pointer must be passed to wxsQuickPropsPanel
 constructor.

    Note that Quick Properties Panel must be managed outside property container.
 Container won't delete it. Only bindings are deleted.

 \warning Do not use OnCreateQuickProperties function for getting panel since it
 does not unbind previous quick properties panel and does not bind new one with
 container correctly.
