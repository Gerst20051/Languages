    <h3 id="_Artistic_Style_Versions">Artistic Style Versions</h3>

    <p>astyle_x.y_linux.tar.gz is the <b>Linux</b> version of Artistic Style. It
    contains the source code, documentation, and makefiles. The Linux Version compile instructions
    below give information for compiling the source code.</p>

    <p>astyle_x.y_macosx.tar.gz is the <b>Mac OS X</b> version of Artistic Style.
    It contains the source code, documentation, and a makefile. The Mac OS X Version compile
    instructions below give information for compiling the source code.</p>

    <p>
        astyle_x_y_openvms.zip is the <b>OpenVMS</b> version of Artistic Style. It
    contains the source code, documentation, object files, build files, and executables. The
    OpenVMS Version compile instructions below give information for compiling the source code.
    Object code is included for people that don't have the Hewlett-Packard C++ compiler.</p>

    <p>astyle_x.y_windows.zip is the <b>Windows</b> version of Artistic Style. It
    contains the source code, documentation, Visual C project files, and an executable. The Windows
    Version compile instructions below give information for compiling the source code.</p>

    <p>Only one platform is supported in each distribution package. If you use
    Artistic Style on more than one platform you will need to download packages for each platform.
    The main difference in platforms is the build directories and the line endings. Most compilers
    and development packages will accept any type of line ending. The source code and documentation
    are the same for all distributions.</p>

    <h3 id="_Linux_Version">Linux Version</h3>

    <h4 id="_GCC_Compiler">GCC Compiler</h4>

    <p>To compile using the GCC compiler you must have GCC (3.1 or better) installed. To build the
    Artistic Style configurations use the makefile located in the astyle/buildgcc directory. The
    executables will be in the astyle/bin directory. To build the command line configuration enter
    the following:</p>
    <pre> cd astyle/buildgcc<br /> make
</pre>

    <p>To build the other astyle configurations you can enter the file name or a symbolic name.
    Entering "make astyle" or "make release" will build the command line configuration. Following
    are the symbolic names and file names (in parens) of the various configurations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>release</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program (astyle). This is the
        default option.</li>

        <li><b>shared</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a shared library
        (libastyle.so).</li>

        <li><b>static</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a static library (libastyle.a).</li>

        <li><b>debug</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program with debugging information
        (astyled).</li>

        <li><b>shareddebug</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a shared library with debugging
        information (libastyled.so).</li>

        <li><b>staticdebug</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a static library with debugging
        information (libastyled.a).</li>

        <li>
            <b>all</b> builds all of the above configurations. 

            <p>The following Java shared library builds are separate from the above. They include
            the Java Native Interface (JNI) and require that the Java Development Kit (JDK) be
            installed. The environment variable JAVA_HOME should be defined. It defines the install
            directory for the JDK. The makefile also has default install directories for Java 5 and
            6. If the compile cannot find the file jni.h, either set the variable or change the
            value in the makefile.</p>
        </li>

        <li><b>java</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a shared library which includes the
        Java Native Interface (libastylej.so).</li>

        <li><b>javadebug</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a shared library which includes
        the Java Native Interface and debugging information (libastylejd.so).</li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">javaall</span> builds all of the above java
        configurations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>More than one configuration can be built at the same time. For example, to build all of the
    release configurations enter:</p>
    <pre> cd astyle/build<br /> make release shared static
</pre>

    <h4 id="_Intel_Compiler">Intel Compiler</h4>

    <p>To build the Artistic Style configurations use the makefile located in the astyle/buildintel
    directory. The executables will be in the astyle/bin directory. To build the command line
    configuration enter the following:</p>
    <pre> cd astyle/buildintel<br /> make
</pre>

    <p>To build the other astyle configurations you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. The
    configuration names for Intel are the same as for the <a href="#_GCC_Compiler">GCC
    compiler</a>. More than one configuration can be built at the same time. For example, to build
    all of the debug configurations enter:</p>
    <pre> cd astyle/buildintel<br /> make debug shareddebug staticdebug
</pre>

    <h4 id="_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile Options</h4>

    <p>The following makefile options are also available for GCC and Intel.</p>

    <h5>clean</h5>

    <p>Removes the object and executable files for all configurations.</p>

    <p>To remove the files for all configurations:</p>
    <pre> make clean
</pre>

    <h5>cleanobj</h5>

    <p>Removes the object files for all configurations. The executables will not be removed.</p>

    <p>To remove only the object files for all configurations:</p>
    <pre> make cleanobj
</pre>

    <h5>install</h5>

    <p>Installs the executable. The default is /usr/bin. You must have the appropriate permissions
    to use install.</p>

    <p>To install the astyle executable to /usr/bin:</p>
    <pre> make install
</pre>

    <p>To install the executable to a different bin directory set a value for the macro $(prefix).
    For example to install the executable to a users home directory (/home/<i>user</i>/bin):</p>
    <pre> make prefix=$HOME install
</pre>

    <h5>uninstall</h5>

    <p>Uninstalls the executable. The default is /usr/bin.</p>

    <p>You must have the appropriate permissions to use uninstall. To uninstall the astyle
    executable from /usr/bin:</p>
    <pre> make uninstall
</pre>

    <p>To uninstall the executable from a different "bin" directory set a value for the macro
    $(prefix). For example to uninstall the executable from a users home directory
    (/home/<i>user</i>/bin):</p>
    <pre> make prefix=$HOME uninstall
</pre>

    <p>NOTE: The uninstall option will NOT remove the .astylerc files from the users home
    directories. The files must be removed individually for each user.</p>

    <h3 id="_Mac_OS_X_Version">Mac OS X Version</h3>

    <p>To build the Artistic Style configurations use the makefile located in the astyle/buildmac
    directory. The executables will be in the astyle/bin directory. To build the command line
    configuration enter the following:</p>
    <pre> cd astyle/buildmac<br /> make
</pre>

    <p>To build the other astyle configurations you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. The
    configurations for Mac are the same as for the <a href="#_GCC_Compiler">Linux GCC compiler</a>.
    More than one configuration can be built at the same time. For example, to build all of the
    release configurations enter:</p>
    <pre> cd astyle/buildmac<br /> make release shared static
</pre><br />

    <p>The <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile Options</a> are the same as for the
    Linux compilers.</p>

    <h3 id="_OpenVMS_Version">OpenVMS Version</h3>

    <p>To build Artistic Style on an OpenVMS system, you will need Hewlett-Packard's C++ compiler
    installed. To build the code, use the OpenVMS specific build file located in the
    astyle/build/vms directory. The executables will be in the astyle/bin directory. To build the
    standalone executable, enter the following:</p>
    <pre> set def [.astyle.build.vms]<br /> @vmsbuild
</pre>

    <p>To run Artistic Style, you should move the standalone executable to an appropriate
    directory, and create a foreign symbol for it. For example:</p>
    <pre> create/dir my_disk:[astyle.exe]<br /> set def [--.bin]<br /> copy astyle_main.exe my_disk:[astyle.exe]<br /> ast*yle :== $my_disk:[astyle.exe]astyle_main.exe
</pre>

    <p>The build command procedure also includes a method to build a sharable image version of the
    program, which can be linked and called from other executable modules.</p>

    <p>Additionally, if you have a Java Development Kit installed, you can build a Java Native
    Interface version of the program, which can be called from Java code.</p>

    <p>To build either of these versions, please see the comments located at the end of the
    VMSBUILD.COM command procedure.</p>

    <p>If you use Artistic Style on ODS-2 disks, you will need to specify a different suffix for
    file renaming, as the default is .orig, and multi-dot filenames are not supported on ODS-2
    disks. Add the --suffix=_orig switch to either the command line or your Artistic Style
    initialization file.</p>

    <p>To set up an initialization file on OpenVMS, create a file and define a logical to point to
    it. For example:</p>
    <pre> create my_disk:[astyle]astyle.ini<br /> --suffix=_orig<br /> ^Z<br /> define artistic_style_options my_disk:[astyle]astyle.ini
</pre>

    <h3 id="_Windows_Version">Windows Version</h3>

    <h4 id="_Precompiled_Executable">Precompiled Executable</h4>

    <p>In addition to the source files, the Windows version contains an astyle executable
    (AStyle.exe).</p>

    <h4 id="_Visual_C++_Compiler">Visual C++ Compiler</h4>

    <p>There is a project file for 3 versions of the Visual C compiler; build/vs2003 (Visual Studio
    2003), build/vs2005 (Visual Studio 2005), and build/vs2008 (Visual Studio 2008). Open the AStyle project
    file in the appropriate AStyle/build directory. Select the Release configuration to compile
    the command line version. All output files will be in the AStyle/bin directory. The project has
    the following configurations.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Release</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program (AStyle.exe).</li>
        <li><strong>Release Static</strong> builds the Artistic Style command line program (AStyle.exe).
            This is the same as the Release build except that it links wth the static run-time
            library instead of the dll. This build must be used if the program is to execute
            on a machine that does not have Visual Studio installed.</li>

        <li><b>Release Dll</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link Library
        (AStyle.dll). This will also produce the exports library and the static library for linking
        the dll.</li>

        <li><b>Release Lib</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Static Library (AStyleLib.lib).
        </li>

        <li><b>Debug</b> builds the Artistic Style command line program with debugging information
        (AStyled.exe).</li>

        <li><b>Debug Dll</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link Library with
        debugging information (AStyled.dll). This will also produce the exports library and the
        static library for linking the dll.</li>

        <li>
            <b>Debug Lib</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Static Library with debugging
            information (AStyleLibd.lib).

            <p>The following Java shared library builds include the Java Native Interface (JNI) and
            require that the Java Development Kit (JDK) be installed. The Project Properties must
            have an include path to the JDK include and include\win32 directories. This is set in
            Project &gt; Properties &gt; C/C++ &gt; General &gt;
            Additional&nbsp;Include&nbsp;Directories. The default setting is for the JDK to be
            installed in the default directory, but it may not be the most current release.</p>
        </li>

        <li><b>Release Java</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link Library which
        includes the Java Native Interface (AStylej.dll).</li>

        <li><b>Debug Java</b> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link Library which
        includes the Java Native Interface and debugging information (AStylejd.dll).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="_Other_Compilers">Other Compilers</h4>

    <p>To use other compilers a project file must be built using the compiler's development
    environment.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a project using the compiler's development environment</li>

        <li>Add to the project all the .cpp and .h files in the src directory.</li>

        <li>The Compiler Options section discusses the compiler options to use.</li>

        <li>Compile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="_Compiler_Options">Compiler Options</h3>

    <p>To compile as a static or shared (dynamic) library define the macro ASTYLE_LIB. To compile a
    Java shared (dynamic) library define the macro ASTYLE_JNI. Then use the appropriate compiler
    and linker options to compile the static or shared library.</p>

    <p>Artistic Style is a small program and it is best to optimize for speed. The debug
    configuration is not usually optimized. To optimize for speed in the release configurations use
    the macro NDEBUG to remove asserts. Use an option that allows inline function expansion.
    Runtime Type Information (RTTI) is NOT needed. Use whole program optimization if your compiler
    supports it. There may be other options you can use depending on the compiler.</p>
