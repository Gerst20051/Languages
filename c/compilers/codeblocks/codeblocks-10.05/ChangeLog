	  from the compiler option, and when there's no compiler then
	  fallback to the hardcoded '.a'

	  wxsItem::IsRootItem instead of wxsItem::GetParent (make code more
	  stable and extensible)

svn3543:  - little fix in autorevision (in revision comparison
	  with existing autorevision.h)

	  option added :
	  - is an advanced compiler option

	  strings ("" "").

2007-01-10 09:35  mandrav

svn3469:  * Scripting updates:
	  - GetScriptingManager().RegisterScriptMenu() signature changed
	  from (scriptFile, menuPath) to (menuPath, scriptFileOrFunction,
	  (bool)isFunction). This allows registering a script-function
	  (instead of a full script) to a menu. Useful, for example, to
	  create a single script with various functions and bind them all
	  to menus.
	  - Added IO.GetCwd() and IO.SetCwd() to get/set the working
	  directory.
	  - Added ProgressDialog script class. Use its single member
	  function Update(value, message) to update it. Value must always
	  lie in the 0-100 range.
	  - Added ShowDialog(xrcFile, dlgName, callbackFunc) function to
	  load and display a dialog from XRC. The callbackFunc is a script
	  function you define to handle all click-events. While in a
	  ShowDialog() call, there are also the EndModal(retCode) and
	  XRCID(controlName) functions available.
	  - Wiki docs soon to be updated.
	  * Main project file (windows) updated to new format.

2007-01-10 09:21  killerbot

svn3468:  * UseFlatObjects setting now also saved in the conf
	  - header cleanup/fixes
	  - 2 methods from member to regular functions
	  - put some code already in place for later on implementing full
	  IsDirty mechanism

2007-01-09 14:17  mortenmacfly

svn3462:  - typo in spec file's changelog (it's already 2007 ;-))

2007-01-05 18:18  daniel2000

svn3460:  * added support for flat objects usage :
	  - "compiler" switch : Advanced compiler options : Other :
	  UseFlatObjects
	  - the object file will be create directly under the object output
	  dir, no subdirs reflecting the source tree
	  * compiler switches structure now has constructor : several
	  switches never got initialized in the different compilers

2007-01-04 15:02  mandrav

svn3459:  - Bug-fix for object names generation in multi-compiler
	  projects.

2007-01-04 13:47  mandrav

svn3458:  * Added per-project notes (accessible through project
	  properties or menu "Project->Notes"). There is also the option to
	  display the project's notes on-load (useful if you want to share
	  your project with others and want to embed some usage/setup
	  instructions, for example).
	  * New project option for generating object filenames. Currently
	  C::B generates a file's filename by replacing its extension with
	  the object extension (e.g. foo.cpp ->foo.o). This option allows
	  you instead to append the object extension (e.g. foo.cpp ->
	  foo.cpp.o). Useful for projects with compileable files having the
	  same name (and in the same directory) but different extensions.
	  * Added new generic dialog containing a multiline text box
	  (read-only or editable; controlled by the constructor). Used for
	  project notes currently.
	  * Project file version upgraded to 1.6. Differences from 1.5
	  include changes to accommodate the above new features plus that
	  now only values that differ from the defaults are saved (so
	  project files are smaller now).
	  * SDK version pumped to 1.11.6.
	  - Script bindings updates for the new cbProject methods.
	  - Minor fix in annoying dialog: left-top alignment for icon.

2007-01-04 13:35  mandrav

svn3457:  * Code-completion:
	  - bug-fix for duplicate C/C++ parser dirs per-project.

svn2990:  -DragScroll fix missing equates == on linux

2006-09-22 12:24  pecan

svn2989:  - DragScroll - Minor addition. #defines for WXMAC.

2006-09-22 09:13  mandrav

svn2988:  * Updated C::B plugin wizard for the latest updates in
	  the plugin loading framework.
	  * Added XML in known file types.
	  * Exported to scripts the XML extension constant (EXT_XML and
	  EXT_DOT_XML) as well as the plugin SDK version
	  (PLUGIN_SDK_VERSION_MAJOR, PLUGIN_SDK_VERSION_MINOR and
	  PLUGIN_SDK_VERSION_RELEASE).

2006-09-21 19:13  mandrav

svn2987:  * Fixed autotools build (added missing $DESTDIR).

2006-09-20 21:08  mandrav

svn2986:  * Updated non-windows build.

2006-09-20 14:16  killerbot

svn2985:  * Check also for modified projects when the app get's
	  (re)activated, so that externally modified project files (.cbp)
	  allow the user to reload them (just like with externally modified
	  files)

2006-09-20 13:08  mandrav

svn2984:  * Added options for build targets to auto-generate the
	  output filename, based on the running platform. This should bring
	  us closer to the final goal of one project file for all
	  platforms.

2006-09-20 13:05  mandrav

svn2983:  * Plugin loading redesigned
	  - All plugins must provide a resource zip file containing at
	  least one file named manifest.xml. Several hard-coded things in a
	  plugin have moved to this manifest file (and more to come).
	  - Got rid of the ugly macros for registering a plugin. Replaced
	  by a templated class.
	  - All plugins in our repository have been updated accordingly.
	  - Autotools builds not yet tested.

2006-09-19 15:36  artoj

svn2982:  Code snippets:
	  * Replaced Clear button with a control button
	  * Added options for searching: case sensitivity and type
	  * Removed extra padding around the tree control

2006-09-18 19:55  killerbot

svn2981:  * [ Patch #1499 ] : To do list can cope now with
	  doxygen style to do's

2006-09-18 10:57  killerbot

svn2979:  * CodeCompletion Toolbar : show namespace in left
	  choice control when outside any function

2006-09-17 17:02  killerbot

svn2977:  * code snippets patch applied

2006-09-14 15:27  mandrav

svn2976:  * Added a small delay before parsing the active file
	  for functions, to allow for quick file switching without the
	  editor lagging behind.

2006-09-13 13:42  mandrav

svn2975:  * Fixed symbols browser flickering/pause on update (for
	  large projects/workspaces).

2006-09-13 13:40  mandrav

svn2974:  * Correctly remember the window size and position from
	  last run, even if maximized.

2006-09-13 13:07  mandrav

svn2973:  * Align all plugin toolbars vertically when
	  initializing the layout. If users are missing some toolbars, they
	  should delete the current layout and it will be fixed.

2006-09-12 14:00  tiwag

svn2972:  - ANSI-build header bug fixed : wxUSE_UNICODE is always
	  defined
	  check with #ifdef wxUSE_UNICODE is not sufficient, use always #if
	  wxUSE_UNICODE

2006-09-11 14:06  pecan

svn2971:  * DragScroll v0.28 Re: Config fonts too small on some
	  Linux systems
	  - Removed all SetFont() calls
	  - Removeed SetBackgroundColor() calls

2006-09-11 10:45  tiwag

svn2970:  - ANSI BUILD patchfile for CB-projectfiles added

2006-09-11 10:12  tiwag

svn2969:  - changed linker libs to be ansi-build compliant (works
	  on XP too)

2006-09-10 21:47  mandrav

svn2968:  * Fixed issue with debugger breakpoints not actually
	  being removed (although it seemed like they were). The issue
	  existed only for pending breakpoints (i.e. breakpoints resolved
	  at runtime, e.g. inside a shared library).

2006-09-10 08:36  mandrav

svn2967:  * Improvements in code-completion parsing.
	  * Typedefs parsing in code-completion is back again.

2006-09-09 21:18  byo

svn2966:  New wxSmith: (please do not test new wxSmith, it's not
	  usable in this commit)
	  * Started implementing wxSmith in more layered style, wxSmith
	  currently contain project integration layer (independent of gui
	  or resource types)
	  * Added wxsGUI / wxsGUIFactory classes
	  * Moved wxsResourceTreeData to separate files / renamed to
	  wxsResourceTreeItemData

2006-09-09 15:09  mandrav

svn2965:  * Disabled last changes in the encoding detector as it
	  is deemed "incomplete".

2006-09-08 23:32  killerbot

svn2964:  - comment out a DBGLOG (will not compile if no pch)
	  NOTE: gdb_tipwindow is not really include correct in case of non
	  pch

2006-09-08 12:28  mandrav

svn2963:  * Fixed bug with saving UTF16 files (since last
	  encoding-related commit). Please be *really* careful with this
	  feature. It still is *not* solid, so avoid editing files for
	  which you have no backup available.

2006-09-08 11:02  mandrav

svn2962:  * Avoid duplicate entries when code-completing
	  #includes (bug #8692).

2006-09-08 10:50  mandrav

svn2961:  * When creating a new empty file, the user is asked to
	  add it in the active project (old behaviour re-instated).

2006-09-08 10:32  mandrav

svn2960:  * Improved the document encoding detector.

2006-09-08 06:14  killerbot

svn2958:  * added perl lexer files (lexer and example)

2006-09-06 18:20  killerbot

svn2957:  * CodeCompletion toolbar : functions in choice control
	  are sorted

2006-09-05 21:06  killerbot

svn2956:  - little update to previous commit

2006-09-05 20:08  killerbot

svn2955:  - fix globals.cpp for ansi build

2006-09-05 07:55  killerbot

svn2954:  * CodeCompletion Toolbar : when cursor outside any
	  function, function choice control should not have a selection

2006-09-04 18:46  mandrav

svn2953:  - Fixed build error.

2006-09-04 17:41  mandrav

svn2952:  - Fixed compile error for non-windows platforms.

2006-09-04 16:50  mandrav

svn2951:  * Fixed wrong appearence of images under pre-XP windows
	  versions. - For the above to work, the global function
	  cbLoadBitmap() was added and every developer is encouraged to use
	  this whenever a bitmap must be loaded from disk. I have already
	  converted everything in the code to use this.

2006-09-04 13:12  mandrav

svn2950:  * Fixed display bug of debugger's tooltips, in rare
	  cases (bug #8604).

2006-09-04 12:47  mandrav

svn2949:  * When closing a project, remove all of its breakpoints
	  from the debugger.

2006-09-04 11:13  mandrav

svn2948:  * Fixed small bug with toolbar sizes (in XP this time,
	  doh).

2006-09-03 20:41  mortenmacfly

svn2947:  - SDK documentation update (fixed doxygen warnings)

2006-09-03 12:46  mandrav

svn2946:  * Updated main project file and all contrib plugins'
	  project files for
	  linux.

2006-09-03 12:45  mandrav

svn2945:  * Fixed freeze in linux when updating the symbols
	  browser.

2006-09-02 21:49  pecan

svn2944:  * cbKeyBinder v0.4.25d
	  - record dynamically changed menu items
	  - Get menu shortcuts via wxAcceratorEntry to appease wxGTK
	  - Add file name to corrupted file message
	  - Non Destructive update of menu items
	  - backup of .ini file to .ini.bak before delete/save

2006-09-02 19:36  killerbot

svn2943:  - this is what happens when you press ctrl-s and the
	  ctrl didn't make it through

2006-09-02 19:29  killerbot

svn2942:  - insertclassmethoddlg : little include fix

2006-09-02 10:47  killerbot

svn2941:  * autodetect compilers : allow only 1 selection for
	  default Compiler
	  - little include cleanup

2006-09-02 09:19  mandrav

svn2940:  * Removed the environment option to enabling the
	  toolbar hack for XP. It is now completely auto-detected if the
	  hack is needed, for all Windows versions.

2006-09-02 08:13  mandrav

svn2939:  - Removed sdk dependency on libwxscintilla.a in project
	  file. Not needed since libwxscintilla.a is a dll import lib.
	  * Fixed a couple of issues when updating the symbols browser.
	  * Added "All class methods without implementation" in editor's
	  context menu ("Insert" submenu). This revealed a bug in the
	  parser, regarding return values with namespaces. So expect it to
	  output code that doesn't compile in these cases (until the parser
	  bug is fixed).
	  * Fixed bad flickering caused the moment the code-completion list
	  was shown. This was caused by a hack in wxScintilla. The
	  side-effect is that the selected word in the list is highlighted
	  in gray instead of blue (standard colors) but this shouldn't be
	  too much of a problem.

2006-09-02 07:56  mandrav

svn2938:  * Added hack to fix toolbar sizes for toolbars that
	  contain windows controls. This hack is automatically applied on
	  all Windows versions prior to XP. An environment option has been
	  added to enable this hack for XP too. This is needed only if you
	  run C::B *without* a manifest file in XP.

2006-08-31 16:33  tiwag

svn2936:  * batchbuild log window auto-closes even when an error
	  occurred during the build,
	  if the option --no-batch-window-close was not given.
	  - Info: a non-zero build-error-code is returned as exit-code when
	  batchbuilding and
	  can be handled by the calling batch-script

2006-08-31 14:34  tiwag

svn2935:  * compilergcc - "Abort Build" : for WXMSW only : write
	  logmessage before skipping the rest of the logstream,
	  it can take a while, until gcc stops the actual build. no change
	  for Linux build.

2006-08-31 14:15  tiwag

svn2934:  * Build options -> "Project/Target change with changed
	  settings" dialog changed to AnnoyingDialog

2006-08-31 12:48  mandrav

svn2933:  - Fix for out-of-place autotools builds.

2006-08-31 12:42  mandrav

svn2932:  - Added check for gtk+-2.0 existence in configure.in.

2006-08-31 11:42  tiwag

svn2931:  - wxWidgets project wizard updated to add the compiler
	  definition
	  __WXDEBUG__ when the wx debug-libraries are selected

2006-08-31 11:12  mandrav

svn2930:  * Fixed (improved) "current file's symbols" symbols
	  browser's view filter.

2006-08-31 10:19  mandrav

svn2929:  - Replaced a hardcoded colour in project's tree with a
	  system-provided one.

2006-08-31 10:17  mandrav

svn2928:  * Each of the special folders (globals) in the symbols
	  browser is coloured gray if it contains no tokens.

2006-08-31 09:45  mandrav

svn2927:  * Symbols browser now keeps the special folders with
	  globals on top, when sorting.
	  * Symbols browser doesn't display container tokens (namespaces,
	  classes, enums) in the bottom list.
	  * Fixed bug in symbols browser which would show a + in front of
	  classes even if no children (especially when option to show
	  inheritance is enabled).

2006-08-31 09:11  killerbot

svn2926:  - minor update to previous commit (better focus)

2006-08-31 07:07  killerbot

svn2925:  * CodeCompletion toolbar added which allows to jump to
	  functions of the current editor and also tracks in which function
	  your cursor is (view->toolbars->codecompletion)

2006-08-30 18:58  mandrav

svn2924:  - Removed an empty function.
	  - Added missing #include.

2006-08-30 16:29  mandrav

svn2923:  * Symbols browser, reloaded.
	  * Re-added the option to dock the symbols browser in the project
	  management pane as a tab.
	  * Improved local scope parsing for code-completion.
	  * Correctly recognize constructors when parsing classes.

2006-08-30 14:18  tiwag

svn2922:  - added compiler option -Winvalid-pch to wxWidgets
	  project wizard

2006-08-29 15:23  byo

	  * Updated files to compile / debug
	  * Commented wxSmith internal wizard
	  * Some small cleanups

2006-08-29 11:16  tiwag

svn2920:  - windows crashhandler uses "My
	  documents\cb-crash-recover" folder
	  current editor files are saved in a subdirectory of the current
	  date & time
	  files with same name are saved with appended increasing numbers
	  e.g. main.cpp.001, main.cpp.002, ...

2006-08-29 10:33  killerbot

svn2919:  * little clean up in compilergcc and removed incorrect
	  delete at destructor

2006-08-28 17:47  mandrav

svn2918:  * Do not try to build the projects tree if the app is
	  shutting down (rare but possible crash).

svn2917:  * Added "project symbols" view filter in symbols
	  browser.

2006-08-28 09:22  mandrav

	  above).

2006-08-28 08:44  mandrav

svn2915:  * Fixed excessive redraws of the symbols browser.
	  * Fixed code-completion parsing of template-based types of
	  variables/functions.
	  - Minor code cleanup in code-completion.

2006-08-27 15:49  mandrav

svn2914:  * Fixed small bug with preprocessor directives handling
	  in code-completion's parser.
	  - Did I mention the huge speedup of the parser in the last couple
	  commits? Parsing time has been cut down by about 50%.

2006-08-27 14:06  mandrav

svn2913:  * Improved code-completion for local scope.
	  - The code-completion parser now saves the starting and ending
	  line of a function's implementation.
	  - Fixed bug in code-completion's tokenizer when some special
	  characters were found inside comments.

2006-08-27 10:12  mandrav

svn2912:  * Improved "Go to function" internal implementation.
	  * Fixed bug in code-completion's tokenizer with preprocessor
	  directives handling.

2006-08-27 07:39  mandrav

svn2911:  * Added "Remove files" popup menu options for virtual
	  folders.

2006-08-26 13:19  mandrav

svn2910:  - Removed a forgotten debug log entry.

2006-08-26 10:48  mandrav

svn2909:  * Code-completion calltips now break up in multiple
	  lines, if they 're too long.

2006-08-26 09:47  mandrav

svn2908:  * Implemented "save to file" for the disassembly
	  window.

2006-08-26 09:30  mandrav

svn2907:  * Force refresh of the disassembly window when starting
	  a new GDB session.

	  Increase default font size (patch #1394).
	  Discover resources, depending if app is bundled or not (patch
	  #1399).

2006-08-26 08:42  mandrav

svn2903:  * Correctly import MSVC* projects under linux (patch
	  #1393).

2006-08-26 08:40  mandrav

svn2902:  * Fixed compilation error in
	  src/plugins/codecompletion/nativeparser.cpp with gcc 3.3 (patch
	  #1391).

2006-08-26 06:51  mandrav

svn2901:  * When editing a virtual target's name, check if the
	  name hasn't been changed and avoid warning that there's another
	  virtual target with the same name.

2006-08-25 17:25  mandrav

svn2900:  * Fixed flashing code-completion list, when no entries
	  in it (would show and then hide, causing a flash).

2006-08-25 16:11  mandrav

svn2899:  * Fixed crash-bug in code-completion parser. Also
	  disabled the handling of typedefs to refine its parsing.

2006-08-25 12:28  mandrav

svn2898:  * Fixed all reported bugs about virtual folders.
	  * Implemented moving virtual folders around (only worked for
	  single files).
	  * Virtual folders are now also properties of the project itself.
	  Meaning you can have empty virtual folders in a project.

2006-08-25 12:14  mandrav

svn2897:  - Committed changed file, forgotten from previous
	  code-completion commit.

2006-08-25 11:43  killerbot

svn2896:  * codesnippets : updated cbp file (windows)

2006-08-25 10:24  mandrav

svn2895:  * Removed "No matches" tooltip when code-completion
	  contains no matches.
	  * Added matching C++ keywords in the code-completion list.

2006-08-25 09:23  mandrav

svn2894:  * Handle special keyword "this" for code-completion.

2006-08-25 08:53  mandrav

svn2893:  * Finally fixed (true!) the symbols browser weirdness.
	  A couple of missing variable initializers in constructors did all
	  the mess...
	  * Re-enabled the option of showing inherited members in the
	  symbols browser.
	  * Added handling of #if[[n]def] preprocessor blocks in
	  code-completion's parser. Currently it accepts the #if part and
	  ignores from the #el[se|if] (if it exists) up to the #endif. The
	  special case "#if 0" will be handled later.

2006-08-24 13:38  mandrav

svn2892:  * Fixed broken code-completion parsing of last few
	  days, manifested by displaying the same symbol multiple times
	  (and as a namespace) in the symbols view.

2006-08-23 18:21  killerbot

svn2891:  * Patch 1387 : OpenedFilesTree did not get updated
	  properly

2006-08-23 17:59  mandrav

svn2888:  * Fix (?) for recent strange behavior of symbols
	  browser.

2006-08-22 14:01  killerbot

svn2887:  * further improvements for codecompletion (local scope)
	  * removed several completion triggers (Fill Ups) (eg : ';' no
	  longer triggers the cc suggestion to be inserted)

2006-08-21 11:00  mandrav

svn2886:  * Updates for determining/handling current scope
	  namespaces in code-completion .

2006-08-21 07:18  killerbot

svn2885:  - InfoWindow : Changed _("") to _T("") because the
	  former interferes with i18n

2006-08-20 21:14  daniel2000

svn2884:  * RPM spec file: Added missing files to filelist

2006-08-20 20:21  mandrav

svn2883:  * Added preliminary support for the "using namespace"
	  directive. Works for file-scope only.

2006-08-20 10:06  mandrav

svn2882:  * Fixed bug with global user vars and paths with
	  spaces.
	  - MacrosManager::ReplaceMacros() no longer uses
	  QuoteStringIfNeeded(), because it's not its job to do it...

2006-08-20 09:13  mandrav

svn2881:  * Fixed recognition of the implementation line for a
	  function token in code-completion. Would store the function's
	  end, instead of the start.
	  * Removed option for symbols browser to dock in the project
	  management notebook. It is now a floating (and docking) window.
	  Fixes bug #8346 too.
	  * Removed false alert for reparsing projects when code-completion
	  options were changed, but no project was open.

2006-08-20 08:40  mandrav

svn2880:  * Correctly update open files list when saving an
	  editor under a different name (bug #8444, patch #1361).

2006-08-19 17:06  mandrav

svn2879:  * Updates to code-completion local scope parsing.

2006-08-19 09:21  thomasdenk

svn2876:  - Added .pot files

2006-08-18 15:24  thomasdenk

svn2875:  * Changed _("") to _T("") because the former interferes
	  with i18n
	  - Made "project format updated" message less redundant.

2006-08-18 13:15  mandrav

svn2874:  - Disabled calltips for function pointers in
	  code-completion. Leads to infinite loop in some cases.

2006-08-18 12:39  mandrav

svn2873:  * Added code-completion preliminary support for
	  typedefs:
	  "typedef struct" is not supported
	  "typedef class" is not supported
	  "typedef enum" is not supported
	  Other typedefs are supported. Yes, even function pointers.

2006-08-18 09:02  mandrav

svn2872:  * Changed default settings for code-completion parser:
	  parse local includes, global includes and preprocessor symbols
	  are enabled now. Everyone's settings will be changed to these
	  defaults.
	  - Changed code-completion plugin version number. Was unfair to
	  still be at 0.1 ;).

2006-08-18 08:16  mandrav

svn2871:  - Two new virtual targets added to CodeBlocks*.cbp:
	  "Core app & plugins" and "Third-party libs".
	  - Updated CodeBlocks*.cbp to format 1.5.

2006-08-18 08:12  mandrav

svn2870:  - Fixed current function arguments parsing in
	  code-completion. Didn't work all the time.
	  - Remove all temporary code-completion tokens (like local
	  variables) before starting a new search.

2006-08-17 13:41  mandrav

svn2869:  * Improved function that discovers which is the
	  namespace/function code-completion kicked in.
	  - Some other minor (cosmetic) code-completion bug-fixes.

2006-08-17 09:22  mandrav

svn2868:  * Suppress multiple info windows, if bearing the same
	  message.

2006-08-17 08:48  mandrav

svn2867:  * Fixed bug introduced with virtual targets, where the

	  - include/pch conflicts resolved

2006-08-16 13:49  mandrav

svn2863:  * Added support for virtual build targets. These are
	  user-defined aliases that group together real build targets. For
	  example, a well-known virtual target is "All". Configuration can
	  be accessed from project properties, "Targets" page, "Virtual
	  targets..." button.
	  - SDK version changed to 1.9.0.
	  - API change for cbProject::[Get|Set]ActiveBuildTarget().

2006-08-16 11:35  mortenmacfly

	  under cursor in editor (on right-click in active editor)

2006-08-16 11:33  killerbot

svn2860:  * TODO plug-in : replaced combobox controls by choice
	  controls

2006-08-16 11:05  killerbot

svn2859:  * fixed some pch/include conflicts

2006-08-16 10:51  mandrav

svn2858:  - Fixed the #includes order in a couple of files. PCH

	  Code-completion proposals are much more correct, based on
	  context.
	  Functions implementation file and line are now correctly
	  identified.
	  Function arguments tooltips (a.k.a. calltips) are now updated
	  dynamically, while typing, reducing the possible matches based on
	  the number of already typed function arguments.
	  Calltips highlight the current argument (only if one matching
	  function signature because of a scintilla limitation).
	  Improved "Go to declaration/implementation" functionality when
	  right-clicking on a token in the editor.
	  * Removed old (custom) code-completion control.
	  - Built-in code-completion debugging tool for C::B developers.
	  Invoke by double-clicking any symbol in the symbols view, while
	  holding Ctrl and Shift.

	  ContribPlugins-unix appropriate

2006-08-14 08:40  mandrav

	  cbEditor (only a couple of events were forwarded).
	  - Fix for debugger plugin which was consuming the
	  EVT_EDITOR_TOOLTIP, never to be seen by other plugins.
	  * wxAUI fix for GTK crashes.
	  * wxAUI fix when loading a saved perspective and some layout
	  items do not exist anymore: the layout does not break, just
	  ignores the missing items.

2006-08-13 20:14  killerbot

svn2842:  * added horizontal scrollbar to multiselect dialog
	  (according to wx : windows only) (== [ Feature Request #2484 ]

svn2836:  * fix for previous commit

2006-08-11 12:03  killerbot

svn2835:  * CB_Coders :
	  - includes fixes (location and non precompiled)
	  - const methods
	  - typo
	  - add to contrib plug-ins unix workspace
	  - changed wxCombo to wxChoice (is in this case sufficient and
	  then we don't suffer the wx 2.6.2 bug on linux)

2006-08-11 09:37  mortenmacfly

svn2834:  - updated cb_koders project file to be compatible with
	  other plugins (removed Unicode suffix)

2006-08-11 09:18  mortenmacfly

svn2829:  - Fixed (i.e. removed) harmless error message when
	  launching a new wizard.

2006-08-08 19:43  mortenmacfly

svn2828:  * added new SDL scripted wizard (thanks sethjackson,
	  slightly modified)

2006-08-08 12:39  mandrav

	  Also fixes correctly the previous crash regarding debugger
	  tooltips.

2006-08-08 09:20  mandrav

svn2826:  * Fixed crash when debugger's tooltip is closed, under
	  certain circumstances.

2006-08-07 21:55  ceniza

	  * Fixed code-completion handling of arrays [].

2006-08-07 10:10  mandrav

svn2819:  * Fixed bug in global variables substitution. Wouldn't
	  substitute GVs while a project was loading, leading to wrong
	  behaviour in certain plugins (like code-completion: it wouldn't
	  parse include dirs defined using GVs).

2006-08-06 16:18  mandrav

svn2818:  * Reset wizards' script state before each run.

2006-08-06 14:50  mandrav

	  have browse button

2006-08-04 13:32  killerbot

svn2812:  * "[ Bug #8026 ] Cancel button commits the action"
	  fixed which also resulted in following fixes :
	  + all comboboxes -> choice controls
	  + reduced state
	  + current compiler : be more consistent : use the member instead
	  of each time retrieving from control
	  + project/target : be more consistent : use the members instead
	  of the tree control
	  + all settings can be cancelled out (except advanced settings and
	  compiler add/delete and autodetect)
	  + so no direct applies of several settings
	  + 3 points of save/apply (selection change/compiler
	  change/apply)user will be queried if save is needed in the first
	  2 cases
	  + some methods did not need to be member methods
	  + DoFillTree now does what it says and no other hidden loading of
	  options
	  + AutoDetectCompiler : also backup extra paths
	  + OnEditVarClick : allow that the value remains the same but the
	  key get's renamed
	  + when project changed compiler : not in all cases the user was
	  queried if the targets should change accordingly their compiler
	  and informed that it's best to rebuild the project
	  + when target changed compiler : also inform the user it's best
	  to rebuild the target (similar to project)

2006-08-03 16:50  mandrav

svn2811:  * Yet another autotools fix.

2006-08-03 16:11  mandrav

svn2806:  * Added missing #include.

2006-08-03 10:36  mandrav

2006-08-02 21:48  killerbot

svn2804:  * [ Patch #1177 ] Mac OS X some simple mac compile
	  fixes (slightly adjusted including fix)

2006-08-02 17:06  mandrav

	  * When debugging, pointers are dereferenced for tooltips (when
	  hovering the mouse over a variable).
	  * Minor cleanup in C::B standard dirs caching.

2006-08-02 07:02  killerbot

svn2800:  * [ Patch #1262 ] Make lexer

2006-08-01 19:11  killerbot

svn2799:  * [ Patch #1259 ] Wrong path to compiler settings

2006-08-01 12:20  mandrav

svn2798:  * Added ConfigManager::GetFolder() and changed
	  signature and semantics of ConfigManager::LocateDataFile(). It
	  now takes a flags value of known dirs (as a bitmask of SearchDirs
	  enumerators) to specify where to look in. Files located in the
	  user's configuration folder (under $HOME) have precedence over
	  globally installed files.
	  * Exported the above functions to scripts as global functions.
	  * Updated critical parts of the code to use the new way to locate
	  their data files. E.g. PluginManager now looks for plugins in the
	  user's config dir too. The same goes for lexers loading as well
	  as for scripts.
	  * When editing a wizard script, it is saved in the user's config
	  dir now (where the user does have write access for sure). From
	  that point on, the specific wizard is marked in red in the "new
	  from template" dialog to signify the fact that it has been
	  customized (overriding the globally installed script).

2006-07-29 18:26  killerbot

	  file open dialog(s)

2006-07-25 14:38  mortenmacfly

svn2782:  * interprete "Cancel" as success for file extension
	  handler (thus no misleading error if user pressed Cancel in the
	  file extension handler dialog)

2006-07-25 12:14  mortenmacfly

svn2781:  * updated scriptedwizard to allow selection of more
	  than one target on FilePathPanels
	  * updated several single-file wizards to allow selection of more

	  re-use

svn2776:  * debugger: made runing the debugee inside the debugger
	  optional (for remote debugging)
	  * debugger: add setup option disassembly-flavor instruction-set
	  (for e.g. ARM debugging)

2006-07-20 16:36  killerbot

svn2775:  * fixed OptionsRelationType of resource include dirs
	  (got bad values due to unintialized variable) and adjusted some
	  project files which probably had the bad setting due to the bug

2006-07-20 13:12  tiwag

svn2774:  * codeblocks app returns batch-build exit code (when
	  batch-build was active)

2006-07-19 22:45  pecan

svn2773:  *KeyBinder v0.22 - Temporary hack to ignore

	  get unselected, now it does

	  used to be a conflict with replace in file settings)

2006-07-15 19:18  killerbot

	  codeblocks main project file

2006-07-15 08:17  daniel2000

2006-07-13 21:29  mandrav

svn2749:  * Autotools fix for "make install" and "make dist".

svn2748:  * Fixed broken autotools build of compiler plugin.

2006-07-13 19:18  mandrav

	  and assigned Ctrl-Shift-N for it.
	  * Creating a new empty file does no longer popup the file

	  is that the user is no longer asked to add the new file to the

	  No functional change.

2006-03-04 21:32  mandrav

	  working dir, which

2006-03-03 17:10  mandrav

svn2133:  * Double-clicking on a breakpoint in the breakpoints
	  window now opens
	  the file (would just focus it if it was already open).

2006-03-03 13:22  mandrav

svn2130:  * Added "Debug->Debugging windows->Examine memory". Not
	  much for now, just dumps 256 bytes starting from the address

svn2121:  * Re-enabled codecompletion parsing thread. Also, a
	  single tokens store is used for the whole workspace, instead of

svn2120:  * fixed some missing includes

2006-03-02 19:12  mandrav

	  + and the running threads

svn2096:  * Converted disassembly dialog to use wxScintilla
	  instead of a list control.
	  * Added editor lexer for MASM assembly.
	  * Changed editor lexer keywords to support up to 9 sets
	  (wxScintilla limit). <Language>, <User> and <Documentation> tags
	  in lexers are now considered obsolete (they still work though).
	  They should be replaced by <Set>. The "index" attribute defines
	  the keyword index for the set (its meaning is different on a
	  per-lexer basis).

2006-03-01 09:48  mandrav

svn2095:  * Removed hardcoding of CPU registers for debugging.
	  All available CPU registers are displayed now.

svn2040:  * Find & Replace functions bugfixes & enhancements:
	  - Find & Replace are wrapping around correctly on first search
	  attempt (no bogus "Result not found" )
	  - Find & FindNext (F3 & Shift-F3) are using the actual selected

	  Find-Dialog is only needed the first time a search is initiated.

	  before)

	  * Fixed bug in scintilla's python lexer, regarding
	  decorators/comments highlighting (patch #1412607).

	  anymore. No more broken lexers after a new lexer is added.
	  * Fixed defining multiple syntax highlighting themes not working.
	  * Editor themes configuration saves only what's different from
	  the lexer files. This shaves off 60% of configuration size, if no
	  theme is customized. Should do the same with compilers
	  configuration some day...

svn1981:  * Fixed syntax highlighting not working for newly
	  created files.

2006-02-09 10:31  mandrav

	  of numeric. No more messing up user-defined compilers. Users
	  should only re-define their user-defined compilers for the last
	  time.
	  * Debugger's debug log can now be shown/hidden without requiring
	  C::B to restart. Will implement this for other logs too.

svn1945:  Image update

2006-02-05 11:10  mandrav

svn1928:  * Fixed crash if workspace load fails cause project no
	  longer exist (patch #1418161).

svn1927:  * Fixed default code for editors not being saved

2006-01-30 14:34  mandrav

svn1903:  * Fixed error line mark covering breakpoint marks (bug

svn1900:  Some image updates

2006-01-30 10:54  mandrav

svn1898:  * Fixed project tree flickering when removing single
	  files or folders from the project. Still remains when removing
	  multiple files but not much can be done.

2006-01-30 10:33  mandrav

svn1897:  * Don't add <dir>/include and <dir>/lib in GCC's
	  auto-detection code (bug #1410668).

2006-01-30 08:22  mandrav

svn1896:  * Compiler error messages now correctly open the file
	  containing the error, even if it belongs to a non-active project

	  parallel build.

2006-01-30 03:35  rickg22

2006-01-29 05:11  rickg22

	  project, this is the only way I could deal with the segfaults
	  issue (sorry).

2006-01-29 02:53  rickg22

svn1892:  Codecompletion:
	  - Reduced memory usage by 50%! :)

2006-01-28 17:07  thomasdenk

svn1889:  * Fixed debugger crash when trying to edit watch in
	  watches tree.

2006-01-27 19:39  thomasdenk

svn1888:  Disabled CB_PRECOMP for compilers that don't support
	  it.
	  This should prevent old compilers from including each and every
	  SDK header for every source file when they are accidentially run
	  with precompilation turned on.
	  This also means that we can now rely on the value of CB_PRECOMP.
	  When building with a compiler that does support precompilation, a
	  good amount of headers does not need to be loaded (as the
	  preprocessor will strip them anyway).

2006-01-27 14:56  mandrav

svn1887:  * Fixed build errors for non-windows builds (by
	  DerMeister).
	  * Fixed a typo in wxString script binding.

	  tested).

2006-01-27 09:41  mandrav

svn1883:  * Fixed some more flickering when closing a project
	  (noticeable in workspaces with more than a couple of projects).
	  * Workspaces are now added to recent projects history again.

2006-01-27 08:24  mandrav

svn1882:  * Added priority for plugin configuration panels so
	  higher priority configuration panels appear higher in the
	  settings dialogs. Currently compiler and debugger plugins have
	  higher priority.

2006-01-27 05:29  rickg22

svn1881:  Code completion: Added missing critical section lockers
	  in parserthread.

2006-01-27 04:42  rickg22

svn1875:  * Merged ym_gdb branch to trunk.

2006-01-26 13:52  thomasdenk

svn1873:  Added new SDK event PROJECT_TARGETS_MODIFIED, fired
	  whenever a target is added, deleted or modified, or when the
	  order of targets is changed.
	  The event is caught by the compiler plugin to update the toolbar
	  target list.

2006-01-26 12:37  thomasdenk

svn1870:  Default code is properly saved now.

2006-01-26 10:55  thomasdenk

svn1869:  Oops... modified project files for the last revision.

2006-01-26 10:55  thomasdenk

svn1868:  Decoupled the autorevision part from the rest of
	  ConfigManager.
	  The SDK still has to be re-linked to reflect revision number
	  changes, unluckily.
	  However, the compiler now only has to parse 575 bytes and two
	  includes instead of 35,500 bytes and a dozen includes every time.

2006-01-26 10:49  thomasdenk

svn1867:  Replaced a few unnecessary wxString(someConstWxString)
	  with someConstWxString

svn1859:  added creation of directory
	  devel/share/codeblocks/images/settings

2006-01-25 12:53  thomasdenk

svn1858:  Made UserVariableManager a manager (which was
	  forgotten).
	  Several smaller manager-related cleanups (removed pointer checks
	  which are unnecessary because of guaranteed order of
	  destruction).

2006-01-25 11:26  tiwag

svn1857:  * added Double-Click to "Select Target" dialog

2006-01-25 10:31  thomasdenk

svn1856:  Added a hack for transparent images under Windows 2000

2006-01-25 04:26  rickg22

2006-01-24 12:52  thomasdenk

	  expanded with a double-click.

2006-01-24 08:15  thomasdenk

svn1846:  Patch [1411966]: Removes comparisons that are useless
	  due to type range.

2006-01-23 23:14  byo

svn1845:  * Modified resource files to work with new
	  configuration system and to be editable in wxSmith
	  * Style property for custom widget in source edit mode is now
	  stored

2006-01-23 22:06  pecan

svn1844:  Keybinder v0.4.13 1/23/2006 5:06 PM
	  Fixed key updating broken by new settings scheme

	  global includes.

	  Codecompletion enabled.

svn1827:  * Added a couple of missing includes.

2006-01-22 01:41  rickg22

svn1826:  * Fixed the annoying "path contains to many '..'!"
	  popups with the new NormalizePath function in globals.cpp (only
	  changed codecompletion, other plugins still need to be updated)
	  * Fixed the long delay at codecompletion startup (removed extra
	  log calls on startup)
	  * Fixed overhead issue with codecompletion when global includes
	  were enabled.

2006-01-21 20:00  mandrav

svn1825:  * Added support for adding AngelScript scripts to the

	  dirs. This fixes once and for all the bug with revision 1813 and
	  allows it to be configurable. Default is *not* to add this dir
	  behind the scenes (i.e. the way it always was).

svn1801:  * Updated contrib plugins workspace.

2006-01-18 10:28  mandrav

	  clicking Preview.
	  * Modified Makefile.am accordingly.
	  * NOTE 1: Some weird behavior when clicking Preview more than
	  once for some predefined styles (I'll just blame AStyle itself
	  for this one).
	  * NOTE 2: The new files still need to be added to the
	  Code::Blocks project file (it's beyond my powers).

2006-01-18 02:51  pecan

2006-01-10 22:32  thomasdenk

svn1706:  Manager framework redesign
	  - No more ManagerProxy
	  - Manager::Get() is a lot less expensive than it was before
	  - Manager::Get() never returns an invalid pointer, the same is
	  true for Manager::GetConfigManager.
	  - All other managers are initialised when they are first
	  referenced and deinitialised in order of dependence during
	  shutdown.
	  - The Manager::GetXXX functions will not automatically return
	  null while the application is shutting down. Instead, a valid
	  pointer is returned as long as the respective manager is
	  available, null thereafter.
	  - Plugins are freed before most core managers (for example
	  EditorManager, ProjectManager, and MessageManager) shut down, so
	  there can never be an invalid pointer for these.
	  - The status of all managers can be verified using the static
	  ManagerXXX::Valid() function.
	  - PersonalityManager correctly works for the --profile=ask option
	  now (showing a list of available profiles)

2006-01-08 15:23  pecan

	  inside it (patch #1394856).

2006-01-08 12:42  mandrav

svn1678:  * Added "Edit->Highlight mode" menu entry for changing
	  the highlighting for the current document.

2006-01-08 10:50  mandrav

	  * Added "Recent files" in "Start here" page.

2006-01-08 09:41  mandrav

	  * Used AnnoyingDialog for layout saving confirmation.

2006-01-08 03:52  pecan

	  ALT no docking will take place.
	  * A couple of fixes to wxAUI (patch submitted to its authors).
	  * Fixed a potential crash under windows when shutting down and
	  docking windows were open. This might fix the similar problem in
	  linux but it hasn't been checked.
	  * The default view layout can no longer be deleted but rather
	  reverted to "factory defaults".
	  * Added wxAUI as a dependency of main app. This forces a re-link
	  of the app when wxAUI is rebuilt.

2006-01-07 10:29  mandrav

	  on some systems).
	  * Added -fexceptions compiler option to a couple of contrib
	  plugins. Without it, precompiled headers were not used.

2006-01-04 23:43  thomasdenk

svn1657:  Added an extra QuoteStringIfNeeded (bug 1397329).
	  Actually this is redundant, but it works this way, and doesn't
	  without.

2006-01-04 22:20  mandrav

svn1656:  * Added wxFlatNotebook in the autotools build system.

2006-01-04 20:39  ceniza

svn1655:  * Added missing -fexceptions flag to the project file
	  so it'll use the precompiled header

2006-01-04 19:58  mandrav

svn1654:  * Added wxFlatNotebook in the project (linux build
	  system *not* yet updated).
	  * Removed old code for editors close button.
	  * Added cbEVT_HIDE_DOCK_WINDOW event.
	  * EditorManager now uses wxFlatNotebook.

2006-01-04 09:18  thomasdenk

svn1652:  Inserted deliberate malfunction into autorevision.
	  autorevision will now continue silently in absence of revision
	  information. This defeats the purpose of revisioning, but it
	  allows to build the project from unversioned files.

2006-01-03 01:25  pecan

svn1651:  keybinder;fixed misattaches;added textCtrl attaches

2006-01-02 17:41  mandrav

2006-01-01 19:28  mandrav

svn1642:  * Re-enabled wxCheckListBox in wxSmith because it
	  wouldn't load properly (don't know why it was disabled in the
	  first place).

2006-01-01 19:23  mandrav

	  CodeBlocks-NewBuild.cbp

2006-01-01 19:21  mandrav

2005-12-29 15:03  mandrav

svn1614:  * Added propgrid files in CodeBlocks-unix.cbp.
	  * Fixed LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running a program. It adds the
	  target's working directory to the runtime linker's path
	  (non-windows platforms).

2005-12-29 14:28  mandrav

svn1613:  * Fix wxSmith build using autotools.

svn1605:  Changed behaviour of ConfigManager::Write(wxString,
	  wxString, bool ignoreEmpty)
	  - if ignoreEmpty is true and the value is wxEmptyString,
	  the command is not ignored, but an existing key is actually
	  *deleted*
	  - this fixes bug [1389932]
	  - it is incorrect behaviour, but it is what people *expect* to
	  happen

2005-12-27 18:22  thomasdenk

svn1604:  Another two Unicode fixes

2005-12-27 18:14  thomasdenk

	  Behold the wrath of Makefile.am :)

2005-12-27 17:31  thomasdenk

svn1602:  Slightly improved "Goto declaration" menu
	  - does not show if Token cannot be found anyway (no more
	  disturbing error message)
	  - if implementation is known, "Goto implementation" is available
	  
	  This still needs to be worked on, "Goto implementation" could be
	  shown a lot more often if the class name / namespace was looked
	  up explicitely.

2005-12-27 16:36  tiwag

svn1601:  * bugfix add standard LibDir "$(#WX.lib)\\gcc_dll"

2005-12-22 14:51  mandrav

svn1581:  * Changed the build process to use a state machine.
	  Each step of the process is executed before going to the next.
	  So, for example, if a pre-build step alters a file in the target
	  which causes recompilation of the target, it is now caught
	  correctly.
	  * Fixed all issues with custom vars not being set correctly (or
	  timely).

2005-12-22 14:47  mandrav

svn1580:  * Added workspace context menu entries to Save, SaveAs

2005-12-22 10:48  mandrav

svn1579:  * Added standard wxWidgets resources in the main

	  * When a watched value changes (turns red), it is automatically
	  expanded and made visible.
	  * Added watches tree context menu entry "Dereference pointer" to
	  dereference the selected pointer value.
	  * Added watches tree context menu entry "Watch '*this'" to add a
	  watch for *this.

2005-12-19 22:43  thomasdenk

2005-12-19 22:38  byo

svn1552:  * Enabled popup menu in editor tabs (unix). Working
	  good with wxGTK-2.6.1 and Gnome 2.12. If it gives trouble to some
	  people we might as well make it optional...

2005-12-18 16:28  mandrav

2005-12-18 14:20  thomasdenk

2005-12-16 23:26  byo

	  bug [1381831]

2005-12-05 13:09  mandrav

	  files)

2005-12-03 23:23  mandrav

svn1438:  * When creating a new project/target, make the

	  #1370744).

2005-12-03 23:10  mandrav

	  later stage because code-completion kicked in too early and the

2005-12-03 23:04  byo

2005-12-03 11:17  mandrav

svn1431:  * Moved main frame showing at the very last stage of
	  the app loading process. This speeds app startup because there's
	  no GUI visible until everything's loaded.
	  * Removed --hidden command-line option. It's implicitly used for
	  batch builds, because the GUI is not responsive anyway.

2005-12-03 09:44  mandrav

svn1430:  * ~35% speed-up of project loading.

2005-12-02 23:25  mandrav

2005-12-02 22:57  mandrav

svn1427:  * Re-enabled custom vars in target options (filename,
	  working dir, etc) which was broken with the latest changes in the
	  compiler.
	  * Fixed single file compilation to work when filename contains
	  spaces.

2005-12-02 21:19  mandrav

svn1426:  * Implemented missing ListBoxImpl::SetList() in
	  wxScintilla (also submitted it as a patch to wxCode).

svn1425:  * Fixed bug (typo) in compiler plugin, which broke the
	  build under linux.

2005-12-01 22:57  thomasdenk

svn1420:  Better block allocator (by order of magnitude faster,
	  and includes performance counters and a leak detector).
	  Made more classes block allocated where it makes sense.
	  Changed heap-allocated Mutexes to stack-allocated
	  CriticalSections.

2005-11-30 14:59  mandrav

svn1419:  * Fix in PersonalityManager to return the default
	  personality if no other specified.

2005-11-30 14:39  mandrav

svn1418:  * Added command line options for batch builds
	  (--hidden, --rebuild and --build). They operate on the
	  project/workspace command-line argument. Still have to save the
	  build log to a file...
	  * Fixed personalities to work again. For each personality, a
	  different .conf file is used (instead of default.conf).

2005-11-30 06:00  cyberkoa

svn1417:  Update style with MASK for different platform

2005-11-30 05:55  cyberkoa

	  * Implemented search in arbitrary paths/filemasks for
	  find-in-files.
	  * Enabled "Search->Find" when no project is open, to allow

	  and the found text was deleted before wrapping around.

svn0978:  * Added EditorBase::OnBeforeBuildContextMenu() and
	  EditorBase::OnAfterBuildContextMenu() which are called before and
	  after (respectively) context menu creation. Used in cbEditor to
	  move the caret to where the mouse cursor is, before creating the
	  context menu. This is because some menu entries scan the word
	  under the cursor and without this, it needed first a left click
	  on the word in interest and then a right click. Now it's done in
	  a simple right-click. This also implements RFE #1264036.

	  the plugin binding.
	  * Updated all plugins in CVS to use the above macros.

	  changes.

	  cbProjectWizardPlugin plugins

2005-10-04 19:02  mandrav

svn0966:  * Re-enabled inheritance calculation in code-completion
	  plugin (accidentally removed when we switched to thread pooling).

2005-10-04 09:17  mandrav

svn0965:  * Fixed bug in code-completion cache saving/loading, by
	  completely redesigning the process. No wonder why code-completion
	  didn't work for a lot of people...

svn0964:  Minor cosmetic changes in the code

2005-10-03 13:38  mandrav

	  when right-clicking a token (provided by code-completion).
	  * Added "Open #include file: [file]" in editor's context menu,

2005-04-15 16:32  mandrav

svn0296:  * Updated unix project file and Makefile.unix

svn0293:  * Added ChooseDirectory() function in globals.cpp - use
	  this if you want a dir selector dialog
	  * Because of the above, absolute paths are now possible where a
	  path is entered (like compiler dirs, working directory, etc)
	  * Replaced all calls to other dir selector dialogs to use the new
	  ChooseDirectory()

2005-04-14 10:04  mandrav

svn0292:  * Bug-fix that, upon "Run", would try to locate the
	  executable in the working dir.

2005-04-14 09:28  mandrav

svn0291:  * Removed calls to wxSafeYield() which disabled input
	  and made the program slower (at least appeared to be)
	  * Updated project file options dialog to support multiple build
	  targets. Contribution by Tim Baker (patch #1182707)

2005-04-14 03:38  rickg22

svn0290:  Added Tim Baker's regexp patch

2005-04-13 18:10  mandrav

svn0289:  * Added initial printing support :)

2005-04-13 13:17  rickg22

svn0288:  Restored opening windows showing (aka flicker) so the
	  program won't seem to be slow

2005-04-13 12:37  mandrav

svn0287:  * Added "working dir" build target property (used for
	  program execution)
	  * Updated code-completion's intelligence to look inside
	  namespaces for unknown tokens

2005-04-13 11:36  mandrav

svn0286:  * Fixed MSVS7 importer to correctly detect .vcproj
	  version and adjust importing accordingly

2005-04-12 11:01  mandrav

	  are now put after the project options (bug #1180420)

2005-04-10 10:01  mandrav

svn0279:  * Updated "about" dialog (contributors part) and
	  contact email

2005-04-10 09:51  mandrav

svn0278:  * Updated dependencies generation for direct-mode,
	  using Tim Baker's patches (#1179956 and #1179950). Changes offer
	  a huge speed increase and there is no need for individual .depend
	  files anymore. One dependency file per-project is used now to
	  cache the file dependencies. The per-target dependency output
	  directory setting is now used only for "make-mode" compiling.

2005-04-10 09:07  mandrav

svn0277:  * Added separate setting for resource compiler dirs
	  * Re-arranged the compiler options dialog: merged the compiler
	  and linker dirs and added resource dirs, all in one page

	  debugging session has been requested (bug #1180013)
	  * Updated win32 Makefile and project

svn0276:  + Added Tim Baker's (yet another) optimization patch
	  for directcommands.cpp
	  * Removed "Esc" accelerator key from "abort" compiler menu
	  (didn't work, anyway)

2005-04-10 02:45  rickg22

svn0275:  + Added maintenance comments and CVS ID tags to
	  directcommands.cpp

2005-04-10 02:37  rickg22

svn0274:  + Added "self" parameter to wxSafeYield for
	  messagemanager (this should allow *in theory* changing tabs. In
	  practice it doesn't work, but doesn't harm either so i'm leaving
	  it like that)
	  + Added user friendly error message to the debugger in case the
	  default debugger is not set up.
	  * Fixed display glitch in the Compiler Settings dialog (xrc).

2005-04-09 22:24  rickg22

svn0273:  To do items for beta 1.8 and above

2005-04-09 19:48  rickg22

	  settings to "Set File associations now")

2005-04-09 07:53  mandrav

	  commands-only targets

svn0268:  * Improved templates handling in class-parser

2005-04-08 05:41  rickg22

svn0267:  * Sped up (a little) project/workspace loading (less
	  flicker, etc)
	  * Added new parameter to EditorManager::Open to speed up project
	  loading (doesn't search for projectfile data anymore, since we
	  already have it)

2005-04-08 01:40  rickg22

svn0266:  * Replaced all occurrences of wxYield() with
	  wxSafeYield(). wxYield() is _NOT_ safe for critical operations
	  and may lead to unexpected crashes.

2005-04-07 13:41  mandrav

svn0265:  * Minor update to class browser to display "jump to
	  implementation" only where appropriate.
	  * Added union support in class-parser
	  * Fixed handling of nameless structs (f.e. used in unions) in
	  class-parser

2005-04-07 12:52  mandrav

svn0264:  * Added "jump to implementation" class-parser
	  functionality for the symbols tab - Needs testing.

2005-04-07 11:22  mandrav

	  declarations on a single line, e.g. "int x,y,z;" (bug #1162313)

svn0262:  * Both single and double-click on a compiler error,
	  jumps to the error line (bug #1178104)

2005-04-07 10:43  mandrav

svn0261:  * Fixed handling of unnamed enums in class-parser
	  * Corrected line number calculation for class-parser tokens (used
	  in "jump to declaration")

2005-04-07 05:47  rickg22

svn0260:  * Moved some methods of Editor Manager into the
	  protected area
	  *** Fixed thread crashing on early exit
	  (TODO: Fix project manager's freeze on early project closing)

2005-04-07 02:57  rickg22

svn0259:  + Added managed thread class for later use.

svn0251:  * Added MSVC7Loader patches contributed by Tim Baker

2005-04-05 04:12  rickg22

svn0246:  + Added notice that says "Find in files not implemented

	  the sash was moved to the top.

2005-04-04 03:41  rickg22

svn0244:  + Added drag and drop support for opening files - send
	  bug reports to rick_g22.

2005-04-03 22:07  rickg22

svn0243:  + Added auxiliary wxWidget classes for the SDK.
	  (xtra_classes.cpp - add your own classes here)

2005-03-27 17:53  rickg22

svn0236:  * Fixed bug #1167477: "Save all projects" resets the
	  workspace name

2005-03-27 07:48  rickg22

svn0235:  * Fixed bug 1167913 (cancel button on close
	  misbehavior)

2005-03-27 07:40  rickg22

svn0234:  * Fixed bug #1167913 (Save project cancel button
	  doesn't work).
	  * Also, modified the workspace/project/files closing process.
	  Before closing ANYTHING, it checks EVERYTHING for modifications

	  the state of the workspace is not modified at all.

2005-03-26 21:32  rickg22

svn0233:  "Cancel" button on close now works when project is

	  compiler for all targets it creates.

2005-03-06 23:53  mandrav

svn0180:  * Fixed MS Visual Studio project importer. Imports

	  Manager::Free().

2005-03-06 19:08  rickg22

svn0168:  Fixed bug [ 1096905 ] Crash under FC2.

	  destroyed after function call - on menu closing they get
	  destroyed again, possibly generating a segfault)

2005-03-05 05:24  rickg22

svn0167:  Modified to load plugins from SDK.
	  Fixed the dreaded "DoClearTargetMenu()" bug (fix must've been
	  lost in CVS somewhere)

	  conversions.

2005-03-04 04:13  rickg22

svn0163:  Removed output/share directory from the project

	  * Changed absolute include paths to relative include paths (no
	  need to set the SDK path
	  in the include paths when relative addressing does the job)

2004-05-28 07:54  mandrav

	  where the user has a library open along with an app that uses
	  that library)
	  Compiler: Display a warning before "Rebuild all projects"

svn0030:  Added ExternalDeps property in ProjectBuildTarget. This
	  way a target can be dependent on an external file (a static lib
	  for example).

	  EditArrayStringDlg but provides a file selector.
	  In src/globals.h APP_VERSION now is defined as 1.0 while another
	  definition APP_ACTUAL_VERSION is 1.0-cvs. Changed it so that
	  config settings don't reset every new release (although a formula
	  for transferring settings should be established).
