Demonstrates a simple TCP/IP time client, using the
Berkeley Sockets API. This program is meant to work
in conjunction with TIMESERV, a simple TCP/IP time server
also available from this site.


Usage
=====

Example of usage:

    [paul@localhost paul]$ ./timeclnt -a 127.0.0.1 -p 3357

Switches:

	-p : specifies remote port of time server
	-a : specifies remote address of time server


Installation
============

If your system supports make, simply type:

at the command line. Otherwise, compile timeclnt.c and
in the usual way to create the executable. You may or may
not need to link in additional libraries for the sockets
functions; check your compiler's documentation.
