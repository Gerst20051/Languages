Logic Behind The Working Of The Virus

 
If I don’t explain the logic(Algorithm) behind the working of the virus,this post will be incomplete. So I’ll explain the logic in a simplified manner. Here I’ll not explain the technical details of the program. If you have further doubts please pass comments.

 
LOGIC:

 
1. First the virus will find the Root partition (Partition on which Windows is installed).

2. Next it will determine whether the Virus file is already copied(Already infected) into X:\Windows\System

3. If not it will just place a copy of itself into X:\Windows\System and makes a registry entry to put this virus file onto the startup.

4. Or else if the virus is already found in the X:\Windows\System directory(folder), then it just gives a command to restart the computer.

This process is repeated every time the PC is restarted.

NOTE: The system will not be restarted as soon as you double click the Sysres.exe file.The restarting process will occur from the next boot of the system.
