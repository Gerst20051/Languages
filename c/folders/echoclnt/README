Function
========

Demonstrates a simple TCP/IP echo client, using the
Berkeley Sockets API. This program is meant to work
in conjunction with ECHOSERV, a simple TCP/IP echo server
also available from this site.


Usage
=====

Example of usage:

    [paul@localhost paul]$ ./echoclnt -a 127.0.0.1 -p 3357

Switches:

	-p : specifies remote port of time server
	-a : specifies remote address of time server


Installation
============

If your system supports make, simply type:

    make

at the command line. Otherwise, compile and link echoclnt.c
and helper.c in the usual way to create the executable. You may or may
not need to link in additional libraries for the sockets
functions; check your compiler's documentation.
