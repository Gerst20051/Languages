Clock.exe

This program demonstrates how to implement a timer.
It is extremely minimal so it's potentially useful
to beginning C programmers.

I merged .data and .text sections and it saved about
1.5 KB. However the linker generates 3 warnings even
though it seems to work perfectly. You can change it
back under Project Options > Macros. Just hit Change
after highlighting LINKFLAGS and erase:

/merge:.data=.text /merge:.rdata=.text /section:.text,rwe


Free to use and mutate or whatever.
