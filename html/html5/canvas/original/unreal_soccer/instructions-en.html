<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p><em>Unreal Soccer</em> is a game of <b>association football</b> (<i>soccer</i>) with quite simple rules. It is played by two opposing teams, comprising four players each. The game is mediated by a <i>referee</i>, who is a penguin.</p>
<h3>Game Time</h3>
<p>You can choose the length of each game, but the exact time when a game ends is decided by the referee, who can, at his penguin discretion, allow compensation for the ball being out of play a lot. The winner is the team that scores the most goals during the game time. If the score is tied by the end of the game time, the game continues until either team scores a goal.</p>
<h3>Progression</h3>
<p>As you beat higher-rated teams, they become available for you to use against even tougher opponents. In order to play against teams that are not yet available for you, you need to choose a game time of at least 10 minutes.</p>
<h1><a name="gamestates">Game States</a></h1>
<ul class="square">
<li><em>Play</em>: The default gameplay state, in which the ball is in play, and normal game rules apply.</li>
<li><em>Kick-off</em>: The ball is positioned in the center of the game field, and either one of the teams is exclusively allowed control of the ball. This occurs in the beginning of each half of a match, and after a goal has been scored. During kick-off, the team opposing the team doing the kick-off cannot go within a certain distance of the ball.</li>
<li><em>Out of field</em>: When the ball goes outside of the game field, it is considered <i>out of play</i>, and needs to be fetched and reinstated into gameplay by the referee. The referee does not drop the ball until all players on the team opposing the team doing the kick-in is outside a certain distance from the ball.</li>
<li><em>Kick-in</em>: The ball is positioned on the edge of the game field by the referee, and the team that was not responsible for putting the ball out of play is exclusively allowed control of the ball. This occurs after an <i>out of field</i>. The team opposing the team doing the kick-in cannot go within a certain distance of the ball.</li>
<li><em>Goal</em>: When either team scores a goal, the ball needs to be fetched and repositioned in the center of the field by the referee. The ball is considered <i>out of play</i> during this period. The referee will not drop the ball until all players are on their respective side of the field, and all players on the team opposing the team doing the kick-off are a certain distance from the ball.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="controls">Controls</a></h1>
