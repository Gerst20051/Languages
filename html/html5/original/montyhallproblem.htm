					<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Wikipedia</a>, <em>"The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle loosely based on the American television game show</em> Let's Make a Deal<em>. The problem is also called the Monty Hall Paradox, as it is a veridical paradox in that the result appears absurd, but is demonstrably true".</em></p>
					
					<blockquote><p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which he knows has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? â€” <em>Whitaker (1990)</em></p></blockquote>
					
					<p>This is a card game which works exactly like the problem mentioned above. Try to demonstrate the odds! <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="show_less">Show less</a></p>
