This is my version of Mouse Gestures that has: 

- Ability to recognize symbols by using angles between two points to compare with the symbols and with the sensitivity. Sensitivity of 0º detects only the drawing of perfect symbols (use "Numpad Mouse" script to achieve this). Sensitivity of 180º makes the first symbol on a list to be launched any time you draw. 
- Second type of sensitivity that limits the effect of the above by the number of points. For example, if an angle doesn't go below the sensitivity angle for 4 points, it goes to another gesture. 
- Gesture actions coded in AHK format. The limit is the sky (that means, what AHK supports). 
- Icons that show when a gesture drawn is being accepted or not by the script or when the drawing is disabled. 
- Time to start and finish drawings. 
- Shortcuts to activate specific gestures actions. 
- More than 100 different symbols to assign to a gesture (now I have 126 symbols on my collection with lines, digits, letters and misc.). 

How to use it: 

Ctrl: Disable/enable script. (Windows NT/2000/XP only) 
RButton: Draw symbol. 

How to add/change/remove gestures/symbols: 

Mouse Gestures.ini file has some gestures and lots of symbols included. You can change anything there (just don't mess with the file).
