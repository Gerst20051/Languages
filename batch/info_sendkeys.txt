Here is the help file for the special keys you need to know to use 
SendKeys (copied directly from the Microsoft help file):

Each key is represented by one or more characters. To specify a 
single keyboard character, use the character itself. For example, 
to represent the letter A, use "A" for string. To represent more 
than one character, append each additional character to the one 
preceding it. To represent the letters A, B, and C, use "ABC" for 
string. The plus sign (+), caret (^), percent sign (%), tilde (~), 
and parentheses ( ) have special meanings to SendKeys. To specify 
one of these characters, enclose it within braces ({}). For 
example, to specify the plus sign, use {+}. Brackets ([ ]) have no 
special meaning to SendKeys, but you must enclose them in braces. 
In other applications, brackets do have a special meaning that may 
be significant when dynamic data exchange (DDE) occurs. To specify 
brace characters, use {{} and {}}. 

To specify characters that aren't displayed when you press a key, 
such as ENTER or TAB, and keys that represent actions rather than 
characters, use the codes shown below: 

Key Code 
BACKSPACE {BACKSPACE}, {BS}, or {BKSP} 
BREAK {BREAK} 
CAPS LOCK {CAPSLOCK} 
DEL or DELETE {DELETE} or {DEL} 
DOWN ARROW {DOWN} 
END {END} 
ENTER {ENTER}or ~ 
ESC {ESC} 
HELP {HELP} 
HOME {HOME} 
INS or INSERT {INSERT} or {INS} 
LEFT ARROW {LEFT} 
NUM LOCK {NUMLOCK} 
PAGE DOWN {PGDN} 
PAGE UP {PGUP} 
PRINT SCREEN {PRTSC} 
RIGHT ARROW {RIGHT} 
SCROLL LOCK {SCROLLLOCK} 
TAB {TAB} 
UP ARROW {UP} 
F1 {F1} 
F2 {F2} 
F3 {F3} 
F4 {F4} 
F5 {F5} 
F6 {F6} 
F7 {F7} 
F8 {F8} 
F9 {F9} 
F10 {F10} 
F11 {F11} 
F12 {F12} 
F13 {F13} 
F14 {F14} 
F15 {F15} 
F16 {F16} 

To specify keys combined with any combination of the SHIFT, CTRL, 
and ALT keys, precede the key code with one or more of the 
following codes: 

Key Code 
SHIFT + 
CTRL ^ 
ALT % 

To specify that any combination of SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT should be 
held down while several other keys are pressed, enclose the code 
for those keys in parentheses. For example, to specify to hold down 
SHIFT while E and C are pressed, use "+(EC)". To specify to hold down 
SHIFT while E is pressed, followed by C without SHIFT, use "+EC". 

To specify repeating keys, use the form {key number}. You must put a 
space between key and number. For example, {LEFT 42} means press the 
LEFT ARROW key 42 times; {h 10} means press H 10 times.
