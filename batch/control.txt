Many times you will have an automated process running that 
you want shut down at a certain time of day. 

Try this:
http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pstools.shtml
The SysInternals web site has loads of incredible free 
utilities. I don't know how they do it.

Also, check out the Resource Kit for your OS. For example, 
the Windows 2000 Resource Kit has a program called PTREE. 
Unfortunately, you have to buy the RK (it isn't available 
as a free download). Find out more about the W2K-RK here:
http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/rktour/server/S_tools.asp

If you don't have Windows 2000, you might investigate what 
utilities are available as part of the resource kit or are 
in the "Zero Administration" kit:

http://www.microsoft.com/windows98/downloads/contents/WURecommended/S_WUFeatured/W98ZAK/Default.asp

PC Magazine wrote a nice utility called "EndItAll 2". 
It's free (as long as you pay for it first) and it 
will allow you batch control shutting down any program. 
Search www.pcmag.com for the term "EndItAll" or try:

Finally, if none of the above pre-built solutions are 
available, you can use Windows Scripting. Scripting is 
standard with Win98 and newer. If you don't have it, 
it's available as a free download. See 
http://www.microsoft.com/scripting
Here is a simple VBS script that will shut down Notepad
by sending an Alt-F4 keystroke:

Dim wsh
Set wsh = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
wsh.AppActivate "Notepad"
wsh.SendKeys "%{F4}"

All you have to do is change the "Notepad" above to match 
the title bar (or just the beginning or end of the title 
bar) of your program. 

To use a VBS script, just save the text with a file 
extension of VBS. If the icon doesn't change to a blue 
scroll, try using quotes around the file name when you 
save it. As a batch file programmer, you'll probably 
want to run your script with a command line like this:
cscript.exe "C:\Path\script.vbs"
Or 
start /wait cscript.exe "C:\Path\script.vbs"


If you have Windows 2000, ME, or newer, you have WMI. If you have 
an older operating system (Win9x), you can download WMI here:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/wmi9x/1.5/W9X/EN-US/wmi9x.exe
WMI allows you to kill processes based on their executable name. 
Here is a VBS script that uses WMI to kill all instances of Notepad:

Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\.\root\cimv2")
strQuery = "Select * from Win32_Process where Name='Notepad.exe'"
Set colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery(strQuery,,48)
For Each objItem in colItems
    objItem.Terminate
Next




Finally, the time of day problem. Your basic approach here 
is to schedule a program to run at a certain time of day. 
This scheduled program will then kill your other program.

Frankly, you might want to read the Windows help on the 
"System Agent" (for Win9x), the "AT" command (a 
command-line program in NT, 2K, and XP), or 
"Scheduled Tasks" (GUI application in NT, 2K, and XP).  
McAfee and Norton Antivirus both include a scheduler 
as well. Finally (a last resort!), I wrote a scheduling 
program:
