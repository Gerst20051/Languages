Portions copyright (c) by their respective authors:

Optimized DES S-box expressions (nonstd.c, sboxes.c) have been produced
by Matthew Kwan.  The corresponding MMX code (parts of x86-mmx.S) is
based on Bruce Ford and Rémi Guyomarch's implementation.

This version of John the Ripper is hereby being made available to you
under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as published

	Relaxed terms for certain components.

In addition or alternatively to the license above, the following
components are available to you under more relaxed terms:

As specified in the corresponding source files (nonstd.c and sboxes.c),
Matthew Kwan's DES S-box expressions may be modified, redistributed, and
used for any purpose, so long as their origin is acknowledged.

As the copyright holder for the bcrypt (Blowfish-based password hashing)
implementation found in John the Ripper, I have placed a derived version
of this implementation in the public domain.  This derived version may
be obtained at:

	http://www.openwall.com/crypt/

The intent is to provide modern password hashing for your servers and
your software (where the GPL restrictions could be a problem).

Finally, I have placed the CRC-32 implementation (crc32.c, crc32.h) in
the public domain.


	Commercial licensing.

Commercial licenses (non-GPL) are available upon request.
