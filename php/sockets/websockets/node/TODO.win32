- Implement setenv / unsetenv

- Implement other stuff missing in node.cc/process
  Like getuid, getgid, setgid, kill etc.

- Implement missing `net` methods
  Are unix sockets similar to windows named pipes? If so, should they be 
  supported? -> currently: no. Complication: they block.

- New libev backend
  The current libev backend supports sockets only. This complicates stuff like
  child processes, stdio. Best would be if node_net switched from exposing
  readyness notifications to using completion notifications, so on windows we
  could use IOCP for sockets. Experts tell me that is really the fastest way
  to work with sockets on windows.

- Child process issues
  * Communication between parent and child is slow; it uses a socketpair
    where a pipe would be much faster. Replace it by a pipe when there
    is a libev backend that supports waiting for a pipe.
  * When a child process spawns the pid is not available straightaway.
    On linux the pid is available immediately because fork() doesn't
    block; on windows a libeio thread is used to call CreateProcess.
    So this can't really be fixed, but it could be worked around by adding a
    'spawn' or 'pid' event.
  * passing socket custom_fds is not supported
  * child_process.exec() only works on systems with msys installed.
    It's because it relies on the 'sh' shell. The default windows shell
    is 'cmd' and it works a little differently. Maybe add an option to
    specify the shell to exec()?

- Make colorful util.inspect work on windows.

- Stdio: support passing sockets between master/child process
  Normal windows applications wouldn't like this, but it can be useful for
  communication between node processes. This requires 
  stdio.isStdinBlocking/isStdoutBlocking to be smarter.

- Skip/fix tests that can never pass on windows

- Find a solution for fs.symlink / fs.lstat / fs.chown
  Windows has different symlink types: file symlinks (vista+),
  directory symlinks (vista+), junction points (xp+) 

- Handle _open_osfhandle failures
  E.g. currently we're using the construct _open_osfhandle(socket/open/accept(...)).
  Now socket() can fail by itself and _open_osfhandle can fail by itself too.
  If socket() fails it returns -1 so _open_osfhandle fails as well, but and we'll always return/throw EBADF.
  If _open_osfhandle fails but socket doesn't, a stray handle is left open. It should be fixed.

- Think about `make install`

- Extensions
  Should be DLLs on windows.

- Link pthreads-w32 statically by default

- Link Mingw libraries statically by default
  Like libstdc++.dll, more maybe.
  Microsoft libs are always there, no static linkage required (e.g. msvcrt, winsock2).

- Make (open?)SSL work

- Support using shared libs (libeio, v8, c-ares)
  Need to link with with a stub library. Libraries should use `dllexport`,
  headers must have `dllimport`.

- V8: push MINGW32 build fixes upstream

- Work around missing pread/pwrite more elegantly
  Currently it's exported from libeio, while it wasn't intended to be exported.
  The libeio workaround implementation sucks, it uses a global mutex.
  It should be possible to implement pread and pwrite using winapi's ReadFile/Writefile
  directly, passing an OVERLAPPED structure while not associating with an completion port.

- Work around missing inet_pton/inet_ntop more elegantly
  Currently it's exported from from c-ares, while it wasn't intended to be exported.
  It prevents linking c-ares dynamically. 

- See what libev/libeio changes can be pushed upstream

- 64-bit build
  Should be possible with MinGW-w64, it's pretty good.

- ... much more probably
