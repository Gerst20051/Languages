server is Apache, but IIS 5 and above have been reported to work also.
	
ProjectPier is not PHP4 compatible.
	
Recommended configuration:
	
: PHP 5.1 or greater
: MySQL 4.1 or greater with InnoDB support (see notes below)
: Apache 2.0 or greater
        
If you do not have these installed on a server or your personal computer,

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

If you are upgrading from ProjectPier 0.8.0.3, do not follow the installation 
steps below, instead see UPGRADE.txt for an upgrade procedure.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
1. Make sure your server meets the requirements, see notes below regarding
   enabling InnoDB support.
2. Download ProjectPier from the project website - http://www.projectpier.org/.
3. Unpack and upload the files to your web server.
4. Direct your browser to the /public/install directory and follow the installation
   procedure.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enabling InnoDB Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some installations of MySQL don't support InnoDB by default.  The ProjectPier installer 
will tell you if your server is not configured to support InnoDB. This is easy to fix: 

1. Open your MySQL options file, the file name is my.cnf (Linux) - usually at /etc/my.cnf 
   or my.ini (Windows) - usually at c:/windows/my.ini.  If you are using the Uniform Server
   on Windows, the file will be named 'my-small' and will need to be edited with a unix 
   compatible editor such as PSPad or EditPad Lite.
2. Comment the skip-innodb line by adding # in front of it (like #skip-innodb). 
3. It would also be good to increase max_allowed_packet to ensure that 
   you'll be able to upload files larger than 1MB. Just add this 
   line bellow #skip-innodb line: 
   set-variable = max_allowed_packet=64M

Alternatively, just install without InnoDB support. The installer will allow you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

for the program. After installation is complete, the language can be changed.
