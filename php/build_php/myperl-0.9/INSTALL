I would love if this was a simple "make install", 
but it is not. 
Most likely you will also need to recompile perl. Most 
distributions do not come with a thread safe perl so you
will probably need to recompile yours. To do this you
need to walk through the perl Configure and say yes
to wanting thread support. You can do a perl -V if you
want to see if it was compiled by default on your system.
Example perl configure :
./Configure -Dusethreads -Duseithreads

The result of not having this enabled is that you will
find that MySQL will core on you. Once you have verified
your perl type:
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

The only step left is for you to load the functions into your version
of MySQL.  The following commans will do this:

CREATE FUNCTION myperl RETURNS STRING SONAME "my_perl.so";
CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION myperlgroup RETURNS STRING SONAME "myperl.so";

To uninstall do this:
DROP FUNCTION myperl;
DROP FUNCTION myperlgroup;

Make sure you always drop a function before installing
a new binary into your lib directory. MySQL will
hang if you don't do this.
