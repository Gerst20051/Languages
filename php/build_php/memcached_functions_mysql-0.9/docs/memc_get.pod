=head1 NAME

memc_get, memc_mget

=head1 UDF 

Libmemcached User Defined Function for MySQL 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

memc_get() is a UDF used to fetch an individual value from the memcached
server from within MySQL. You must pass in a key to fetch the object.

memc_get_by_key() is a UDF used to fetch an individual value from the memcached
server from within MySQL. You must pass in a master key, as well as a key to fetch
the object.

memcached_mget() <this function  is not yet complete>
is used to select multiple keys at once. For multiple key
operations it is always faster to use this function. This function always
works asynchronously. memcached_fetch() is then used to retrieve any keys
found. No error is given on keys that are not found.

=head1 RETURN

Data stored in Memcached keyed by supplied hash value

=head1 USAGE

memc_get('keyfoo') <-- fetches object stored as 'keyfoo'
memc_get_by_key('masterA', 'keyfoo') <-- fetches object stored as 'keyfoo'
