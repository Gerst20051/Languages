Description
===========
AtNow is a command-line utility that schedules programs and commands to run
in the near future. By default, the commands are executed within 70 seconds
or less from the moment that you run the AtNow utility with the desired command. 

Syntax
======
AtNow [\\ComputerName] [Delay] [/interactive] "command" [parameters]

\\ComputerName 	
Specifies a remote computer. If this parameter is omitted, the commands are 
executed on the local computer

Delay		
Specifies when the command is to run, expressed as a number of seconds from
the current time. The default is 70 seconds. In most cases, you should 
not change this value (See the notice below)
Notice: In most systems, there is a nasty bug in Microsoft Scheduler Service:
When you schedule a command for a specific time, the seconds in the scheduled
time are always truncated. For example: if a command is scheduled to execute 
at 16:35:32, it'll actually be executed at 16:35:00. Due to this bug, 
the delay value must be greater than 60 seconds. Otherwise, the command might
not be executed.
 

/interactive	
If this parameter is specified, the executed program can
interact with the desktop of user who is currently logged on.
(Similar to /interactive parameter in AT command) 

"command"	
Specifies the Windows NT command or program. If the command 
contains space characters, you must enclose the command with quotes.


Parameters	
Specifies the parameters of the program.
