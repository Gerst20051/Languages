  Check if a table name may cause problems

  SYNOPSIS
    check_if_legal_tablename
    name 	Table name (without any extensions)

  DESCRIPTION
    We don't check 'CLOCK$' because dollar sign is encoded as @0024,
    making table file name 'CLOCK@0024', which is safe.
    This is why we start lookup from the second element
    (i.e. &reserver_name[1])

  RETURN
    0  ok
    1  reserved file name
