  This is a "work in progress". The concept needs to be replicated throughout
  the code, but we will start with baby steps for the moment. To not incur
  cost until we are complete, for the moment it will do no allocation.

  This is mainly here so that it can be used in the SE interface for
  the time being.

  This will replace Table_ident.
