/**
  Rowid-Ordered Retrieval (ROR) index intersection quick select.
  This quick select produces intersection of row sequences returned
  by several QuickRangeSelects it "merges".

  All merged QuickRangeSelects must return rowids in rowid order.
  QuickRorIntersectSelect will return rows in rowid order, too.

  All merged quick selects retrieve {rowid, covered_fields} tuples (not full
  table records).
  QuickRorIntersectSelect retrieves full records if it is not being used
  by QuickRorIntersectSelect and all merged quick selects together don't
  cover needed all fields.

  If one of the merged quick selects is a Clustered PK range scan, it is
  used only to filter rowid sequence produced by other merged quick selects.
