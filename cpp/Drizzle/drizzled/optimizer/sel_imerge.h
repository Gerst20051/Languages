     SYNOPSIS
     or_sel_tree_with_checks()
     param    Parameter from SqlSelect::test_quick_select
     new_tree optimizer::SEL_TREE with type KEY or KEY_SMALLER.

     NOTES
     This does the following:
     (t_1||...||t_k)||new_tree =
     either
     = (t_1||...||t_k||new_tree)
     or
     = (t_1||....||(t_j|| new_tree)||...||t_k),

     where t_i, y are optimizer::SEL_TREEs.
     new_tree is combined with the first t_j it has a SEL_ARG on common
     key with. As a consequence of this, choice of keys to do index_merge
     read may depend on the order of conditions in WHERE part of the query.

     RETURN
     0  OK
     1  One of the trees was combined with new_tree to optimizer::SEL_TREE::ALWAYS,
     and (*this) should be discarded.
     -1  An error occurred.
