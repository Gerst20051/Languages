\fBdrizzle [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdrizzle\fR
is a simple SQL shell (with GNU
readline
capabilities). It supports interactive and non\-interactive use. When used interactively, query results are presented in an ASCII\-table format. When used non\-interactively (for example, as a filter), the result is presented in tab\-separated format. The output format can be changed using command options.
.PP
If you have problems due to insufficient memory for large result sets, use the
\fB\-\-quick\fR
option. This forces
\fBdrizzle\fR
to retrieve results from the server a row at a time rather than retrieving the entire result set and buffering it in memory before displaying it.
.PP
Using
\fBdrizzle\fR
is very easy. Invoke it from the prompt of your command interpreter as follows:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBdrizzle \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
Or:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBdrizzle \-\-user=\fR\fB\fIuser_name\fR\fR\fB \-\-password=\fR\fB\fIyour_password\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
Then type an SQL statement, end it with
\(lq;\(rq,
\\g, or
\\G
and press Enter.
.PP
Typing Control\-C causes
\fBdrizzle\fR
to attempt to kill the current statement. If this cannot be done, or Control\-C is typed again before the statement is killed,
\fBdrizzle\fR
exits.
.PP
You can execute SQL statements in a script file (batch file) like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBdrizzle \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR\fB < \fR\fB\fIscript.sql\fR\fR\fB > \fR\fB\fIoutput.tab\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.SH "\fBDRIZZLE\fR OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdrizzle\fR
supports the options in the following list.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-help\fR,
\fB\-?\fR
.sp
Display a help message and exit.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-auto\-rehash\fR
.sp
Enable automatic rehashing. This option is on by default, which enables database, table, and column name completion. Use
\fB\-\-disable\-auto\-rehash\fR
to disable rehashing. That causes
\fBdrizzle\fR
to start faster, but you must issue the
rehash
command if you want to use name completion.
.sp
To complete a name, enter the first part and press Tab. If the name is unambiguous,
\fBdrizzle\fR
completes it. Otherwise, you can press Tab again to see the possible names that begin with what you have typed so far. Completion does not occur if there is no default database.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-auto\-vertical\-output\fR
.sp
Causes result sets to be displayed vertically if they are too wide for the current window, and using normal tabular format otherwise. (This applies to statements terminated by
;
or
\\G.) This option was added in Drizzle 6.0.4.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-batch\fR,
\fB\-B\fR
.sp
Print results using tab as the column separator, with each row on a new line. With this option,
\fBdrizzle\fR
does not use the history file.
.sp
Batch mode results in non\-tabular output format and escaping of special characters. Escaping may be disabled by using raw mode; see the description for the
\fB\-\-raw\fR
option.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-character\-sets\-dir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
The directory where character sets are installed. See
Section\ 9.2, \(lqThe Character Set Used for Data and Sorting\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-column\-names\fR
.sp
Write column names in results.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-column\-type\-info\fR,
\fB\-m\fR
.sp
Display result set metadata.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-comments\fR,
\fB\-c\fR
.sp
Whether to preserve comments in statements sent to the server. The default is \-\-skip\-comments (discard comments), enable with \-\-comments (preserve comments). This option was added in Drizzle 6.0.4.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-compress\fR,
\fB\-C\fR
.sp
Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both support compression.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-database=\fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR,
\fB\-D \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR
.sp
The database to use. This is useful primarily in an option file.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-debug\-check\fR
.sp
Print some debugging information when the program exits.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-debug\-info\fR,
\fB\-T\fR
.sp
Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics when the program exits.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-delimiter=\fR\fB\fIstr\fR\fR
.sp
Set the statement delimiter. The default is the semicolon character (\(lq;\(rq).
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-disable\-named\-commands\fR
.sp
Disable named commands. Use the
\\*
form only, or use named commands only at the beginning of a line ending with a semicolon (\(lq;\(rq).
\fBdrizzle\fR
starts with this option
\fIenabled\fR
by default. However, even with this option, long\-format commands still work from the first line. See
the section called \(lq\fBMYSQL\fR COMMANDS\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-execute=\fR\fB\fIstatement\fR\fR,
\fB\-e \fR\fB\fIstatement\fR\fR
.sp
Execute the statement and quit. The default output format is like that produced with
\fB\-\-batch\fR. See
Section\ 4.2.3.1, \(lqUsing Options on the Command Line\(rq, for some examples.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-force\fR,
\fB\-f\fR
.sp
Continue even if an SQL error occurs.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-host=\fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR,
\fB\-h \fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR

SQL mode (see
Section\ 5.1.7, \(lqServer SQL Modes\(rq).
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-line\-numbers\fR
.sp
Write line numbers for errors. Disable this with
\fB\-\-skip\-line\-numbers\fR.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-local\-infile[={0|1}]\fR
.sp
Enable or disable
LOCAL
capability for
LOAD DATA INFILE. With no value, the option enables
LOCAL. The option may be given as
\fB\-\-local\-infile=0\fR
or
\fB\-\-local\-infile=1\fR
to explicitly disable or enable
LOCAL. Enabling
LOCAL
has no effect if the server does not also support it.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-named\-commands\fR,
\fB\-G\fR
.sp
Enable named
\fBdrizzle\fR
commands. Long\-format commands are allowed, not just short\-format commands. For example,
quit
and
\\q
both are recognized. Use
\fB\-\-skip\-named\-commands\fR
to disable named commands. See
the section called \(lq\fBMYSQL\fR COMMANDS\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-no\-auto\-rehash\fR,
\fB\-A\fR
.sp
Deprecated form of
\fB\-skip\-auto\-rehash\fR. Use
\fB\-\-disable\-auto\-rehash\fR
instead. See the description for
\fB\-\-auto\-rehash\fR.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-no\-beep\fR,
\fB\-b\fR
.sp
Do not beep when errors occur.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-no\-named\-commands\fR,
\fB\-g\fR

\fB\-\-disable\-named\-commands\fR
instead.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-no\-pager\fR
.sp
Deprecated form of
\fB\-\-skip\-pager\fR. See the
\fB\-\-pager\fR
option.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-no\-tee\fR
.sp
Do not copy output to a file.
the section called \(lq\fBMYSQL\fR COMMANDS\(rq, discusses tee files further.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-one\-database\fR,
\fB\-o\fR
.sp
Ignore statements except those for the default database named on the command line. This is useful for skipping updates to other databases in the binary log.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-pager[=\fR\fB\fIcommand\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
Use the given command for paging query output. If the command is omitted, the default pager is the value of your
PAGER
environment variable. Valid pagers are
\fBless\fR,
\fBmore\fR,
\fBcat [> filename]\fR, and so forth. This option works only on Unix. It does not work in batch mode. To disable paging, use
\fB\-\-skip\-pager\fR.
the section called \(lq\fBMYSQL\fR COMMANDS\(rq, discusses output paging further.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-password[=\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR\fB]\fR,
\fB\-P[\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the short option form (\fB\-p\fR), you
\fIcannot\fR
have a space between the option and the password. If you omit the
\fIpassword\fR
value following the
\fB\-\-password\fR
or
\fB\-p\fR
option on the command line, you are prompted for one.
.sp
Specifying a password on the command line should be considered insecure. See
Section\ 5.5.6.2, \(lqEnd\-User Guidelines for Password Security\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-pipe\fR,
\fB\-W\fR
.sp
On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option applies only for connections to a local server, and only if the server supports named\-pipe connections.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-port=\fR\fB\fIport_num\fR\fR,
\fB\-p \fR\fB\fIport_num\fR\fR
.sp
The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-prompt=\fR\fB\fIformat_str\fR\fR
.sp
Set the prompt to the specified format. The default is
drizzle>. The special sequences that the prompt can contain are described in
the section called \(lq\fBMYSQL\fR COMMANDS\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}\fR
.sp
The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the allowable values, see
Section\ 4.2.2, \(lqConnecting to the Drizzle Server\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-quick\fR,
\fB\-q\fR
.sp
Do not cache each query result, print each row as it is received. This may slow down the server if the output is suspended. With this option,
\fBdrizzle\fR
does not use the history file.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-raw\fR,
\fB\-r\fR
.sp
For tabular output, the
\(lqboxing\(rq
around columns enables one column value to be distinguished from another. For non\-tabular output (such as is produced in batch mode or when the
\fB\-\-batch\fR
or
\fB\-\-silent\fR
option is given), special characters are escaped in the output so they can be identified easily. Newline, tab,
NUL, and backslash are written as
\\n,
\\t,
\\0, and
\\\\. The
\fB\-\-raw\fR
option disables this character escaping.
.sp
The following example demonstrates tabular versus non\-tabular output and the use of raw mode to disable escaping:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
% \fBdrizzle\fR
drizzle> SELECT CHAR(92);
+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
| CHAR(92) |
+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+

.RE
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-reconnect\fR
.sp
If the connection to the server is lost, automatically try to reconnect. A single reconnect attempt is made each time the connection is lost. To suppress reconnection behavior, use
\fB\-\-skip\-reconnect\fR.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-safe\-updates\fR,
\fB\-\-i\-am\-a\-dummy\fR,
\fB\-U\fR
.sp
Allow only those
UPDATE
and
DELETE
statements that specify which rows to modify by using key values. If you have set this option in an option file, you can override it by using
\fB\-\-safe\-updates\fR
on the command line. See
the section called \(lq\fBMYSQL\fR TIPS\(rq, for more information about this option.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-secure\-auth\fR
.sp
Do not send passwords to the server in old (pre\-4.1.1) format. This prevents connections except for servers that use the newer password format.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-show\-warnings\fR
.sp
Cause warnings to be shown after each statement if there are any. This option applies to interactive and batch mode.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-sigint\-ignore\fR
.sp
Ignore
SIGINT
signals (typically the result of typing Control\-C).
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-silent\fR,
\fB\-s\fR
.sp
Silent mode. Produce less output. This option can be given multiple times to produce less and less output.
.sp
This option results in non\-tabular output format and escaping of special characters. Escaping may be disabled by using raw mode; see the description for the
\fB\-\-raw\fR
option.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-skip\-column\-names\fR,
\fB\-N\fR
.sp
Do not write column names in results. The short format,
\fB\-N\fR
is deprecated, use the long format instead.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-skip\-line\-numbers\fR,
\fB\-L\fR
.sp
Do not write line numbers for errors. Useful when you want to compare result files that include error messages. The short format,

.PP
On Unix, the
\fBmysql\fR
client writes a record of executed statements to a history file. By default, this file is named
\fI.mysql_history\fR
and is created in your home directory. To specify a different file, set the value of the
MYSQL_HISTFILE
environment variable.
.PP
The
\fI.mysql_history\fR
should be protected with a restrictive access mode because sensitive information might be written to it, such as the text of SQL statements that contain passwords. See
Section\ 5.5.6.2, \(lqEnd\-User Guidelines for Password Security\(rq.
.PP
If you do not want to maintain a history file, first remove
\fI.mysql_history\fR
if it exists, and then use either of the following techniques:

.TP 3n
\(bu
\fBdelimiter \fR\fB\fIstr\fR\fR,
\fB\\d \fR\fB\fIstr\fR\fR
.sp
The
delimiter
command changes the string that
\fBmysql\fR
interprets as the separator between SQL statements. The default is the semicolon character (\(lq;\(rq).
.sp
The delimiter can be specified as an unquoted or quoted argument. Quoting can be done with either single quote (') or douple quote (") characters. To include a quote within a quoted string, either quote the string with the other quote character or escape the quote with a backslash (\(lq\\\(rq) character. Backslash should be avoided outside of quoted strings because it is the escape character for Drizzle. For an unquoted argument, the delmiter is read up to the first space or end of line. For a quoted argument, the delimiter is read up to the matching quote on the line.
.sp
When the delimiter recognized by
\fBmysql\fR
is set to something other than the default of
\(lq;\(rq, instances of that character are sent to the server without interpretation. However, the server itself still interprets
\(lq;\(rq
as a statement delimiter and processes statements accordingly. This behavior on the server side comes into play for multiple\-statement execution (see
Section\ 20.10.12, \(lqC API Support for Multiple Statement Execution\(rq), and for parsing the body of stored procedures and functions, triggers, and events (see
Section\ 18.1, \(lqDefining Stored Programs\(rq).

\fB\\P [\fR\fB\fIcommand\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
By using the
\fB\-\-pager\fR
option when you invoke
\fBmysql\fR, it is possible to browse or search query results in interactive mode with Unix programs such as
\fBless\fR,
\fBmore\fR, or any other similar program. If you specify no value for the option,
\fBmysql\fR
checks the value of the
PAGER
environment variable and sets the pager to that.
.sp
Output paging can be enabled interactively with the
\fBpager\fR
command and disabled with
\fBnopager\fR. The command takes an optional argument; if given, the paging program is set to that. With no argument, the pager is set to the pager that was set on the command line, or
stdout
if no pager was specified.
.sp
Output paging works only in Unix because it uses the
popen()
function, which does not exist on Windows. For Windows, the
\fBtee\fR
option can be used instead to save query output, although it is not as convenient as
\fBpager\fR
for browsing output in some situations.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fBprint\fR,

.TP 3n
\(bu
\fBprompt [\fR\fB\fIstr\fR\fR\fB]\fR,
\fB\\R [\fR\fB\fIstr\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
Reconfigures the
\fBmysql\fR
prompt to the given string. The special character sequences that can be used in the prompt are described later in this section.
.sp
If you specify the
prompt
command with no argument,
\fBmysql\fR
resets the prompt to the default of
mysql>.

.sp
By using the
\fB\-\-tee\fR
option when you invoke
\fBmysql\fR, you can log statements and their output. All the data displayed on the screen is appended into a given file. This can be very useful for debugging purposes also.
\fBmysql\fR
flushes results to the file after each statement, just before it prints its next prompt.
.sp
You can enable this feature interactively with the
\fBtee\fR
command. Without a parameter, the previous file is used. The
\fBtee\fR
file can be disabled with the
\fBnotee\fR

\fBtee\fR
again re\-enables logging.
.TP 3n

Here are a few tips about the

You can use it to write to a file and the results go only to the file:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBpager cat > /tmp/log.txt\fR
.fi
.RE
You can also pass any options for the program that you want to use as your pager:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBpager less \-n \-i \-S\fR
.fi
.RE
.TP 3n
\(bu
In the preceding example, note the
\fB\-S\fR
option. You may find it very useful for browsing wide query results. Sometimes a very wide result set is difficult to read on the screen. The
\fB\-S\fR
option to
\fBless\fR
can make the result set much more readable because you can scroll it horizontally using the left\-arrow and right\-arrow keys. You can also use
\fB\-S\fR
interactively within
\fBless\fR
to switch the horizontal\-browse mode on and off. For more information, read the
\fBless\fR
manual page:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBman less\fR
.fi
.RE
.TP 3n
\(bu
The
\fB\-F\fR
and
\fB\-X\fR
options may be used with
\fBless\fR
to cause it to exit if output fits on one screen, which is convenient when no scrolling is necessary:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBpager less \-n \-i \-S \-F \-X\fR
.fi
.RE
.TP 3n

You can specify very complex pager commands for handling query output:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBpager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt \\\fR
          \fB| tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less \-n \-i \-S\fR
.fi
.RE
In this example, the command would send query results to two files in two different directories on two different file systems mounted on
\fI/dr1\fR
and
\fI/dr2\fR, yet still display the results onscreen via
\fBless\fR.
.sp
.RE
.PP
You can also combine the
\fBtee\fR
and
\fBpager\fR
functions. Have a
\fBtee\fR
file enabled and
\fBpager\fR
set to
\fBless\fR, and you are able to browse the results using the
\fBless\fR
program and still have everything appended into a file the same time. The difference between the Unix
\fBtee\fR
used with the
\fBpager\fR
command and the
\fBmysql\fR
built\-in
\fBtee\fR
command is that the built\-in
\fBtee\fR
works even if you do not have the Unix
\fBtee\fR
available. The built\-in
\fBtee\fR
also logs everything that is printed on the screen, whereas the Unix
\fBtee\fR
used with
\fBpager\fR
does not log quite that much. Additionally,
\fBtee\fR
file logging can be turned on and off interactively from within
\fBmysql\fR. This is useful when you want to log some queries to a file, but not others.

For beginners, a useful startup option is
\fB\-\-safe\-updates\fR
(or
\fB\-\-i\-am\-a\-dummy\fR, which has the same effect). It is helpful for cases when you might have issued a
DELETE FROM \fItbl_name\fR

\fB\-\-safe\-updates\fR, you can delete rows only by specifying the key values that identify them. This helps prevent accidents.

When you use the
\fB\-\-safe\-updates\fR
option,
\fBmysql\fR
