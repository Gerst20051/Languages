Introduction
============

Drizzle's development primarily happens on
`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/drizzle>`_ which handles code hosting, bugs tracking,
mailing lists and everything else needed for project management.  You will need
a `Launchpad account <https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/NewAccount>`_
before making most kinds of contributions.

One of Drizzle's aims is to have community contributions valued in the same way
as core developer contributions, and to have all code undergo exactly the same
approval and testing process no matter who it comes from (core developers or
general community).

There are many ways to contribute to Drizzle. For example, you can:

 * `File a bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/drizzle/+filebug>`_
 * `Write translations <https://translations.launchpad.net/drizzle>`_
 * :ref:`Write documentation <documentation-label>`
 * :ref:`Write code <code-label>`

We recommend anyone new to Drizzle who wants to learn the code see the
`Low hanging fruit <https://bugs.launchpad.net/drizzle/+bugs?field.tag=low-hanging-fruit>`_
list of bugs on Launchpad for possible tasks to take on.

Bazaar
------

Launchpad uses `Bazaar <https://launchpad.net/bazaar>`_ for revision control of
the source repositories and for documentation.  You will need this installed before contributing
documentation or code.
