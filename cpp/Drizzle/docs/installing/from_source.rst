these additional dependencies:

 * libcurl4-gnutls-dev
 * libgcrypt11-dev

.. _ubuntu-install:

Ubuntu Install Commands
-------------------------

The following commands work on Ubuntu to install the tools and libraries needed to build Drizzle:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:drizzle-developers/ppa
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install drizzle-dev

.. _debian-install:

Debian Install Commands
-------------------------

Since apt-repository isn't in Debian, you can instead add the Maverick PPA to /etc/apt/sources.list as follows:

Add the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list (make sure it's two
lines): ::

	deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/drizzle-developers/ppa/ubuntu maverick main
	deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/drizzle-developers/ppa/ubuntu maverick main

Add the signing key to your keyring: ::

	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 06899068

Then run:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get update; apt-get install drizzle-dev

Note that these instructions are only for Debian Squeeze. For current
unstable/testing (aka Wheezy), the recommended source for Drizzle is the
main repository. In other words:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get install drizzle-dev

or (if you want to install and not build drizzle):

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get install drizzle 

.. _obtain-source:

Obtaining The Source
--------------------
The latest source release can always be found on our `LaunchPad site
<https://launchpad.net/drizzle>`_. Alternatively, the bzr source from our stable
trunk can be obtained by doing:

.. code-block:: bash

   bzr branch lp:drizzle

.. note::

   If you are planning on using the bzr source for writing contributions please
   follow the bzr instructions in :doc:`/contributing/code` instead.

.. _compile-source:

Compiling The Source
--------------------
Compiling is done by performing the standard automake commands from the top level directory inside the source:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./config/autorun.sh
   ./configure
   make
   make install
