Drizzle is a transactional, relational, community-driven open-source database that is forked from the popular MySQL database.

The Drizzle team has removed non-essential code, has re-factored the remaining code, and has converted the code to modern C++ and modern libraries.

Charter
 * A database optimized for Cloud infrastructure and Web applications
 * Design for massive concurrency on modern multi-CPU architectures
 * Optimize memory use for increased performance and parallelism
 * Open source, open community, open design

Scope
 * Re-designed modular architecture providing plugins with defined APIs
 * Simple design for ease of use and administration
 * Reliable, ACID transactional
