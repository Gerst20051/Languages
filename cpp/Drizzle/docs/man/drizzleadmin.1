The \fBdrizzleadmin\fP command line client is the primary program for
connecting to and manipulating a Drizzle database with an administrative user rights.
.sp
The \fBdrizzleadmin\fP tool can only connect using the \(aqroot\(aq user and
only on IP addresses defined by drizzle\-protocol.admin\-ip\-addresses or
mysql\-protocol.admin\-ip\-addresses.  At the moment the \fBdrizzleadmin\fP
tool is only to be used to bypass the protocol\(aqs max\-connections setting to do
tasks such as killing queries or clients.  Eventually more administrative
features will be added.
