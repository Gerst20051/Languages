Tables
======

A table makes up a collection of :doc:`/columntypes` that
can be joined together in order to create relational result sets. 

Each record in the table is called a row, and a table can have an infinite
set of rows. Each row represents one piece of data, and each column can
be thought of as representing a component of that piece of data. 

So, for example, if we have a table for a customer information, then
the columns may include information such as First Name, Last Name,
Address, City, Country, Birth Date, and so on. As a result, tables have
column headers, which specify the data types for that particular column.
