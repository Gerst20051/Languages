#               Main code of several index_merge tests
#                            -> include/index_merge*.inc
#               wrapper t/index_merge_innodb.test sources now several

--source include/have_innodb.inc

# InnoDB does not support Merge tables (affects include/index_merge1.inc)

# The first two tests are disabled because of non deterministic explain output.
# If include/index_merge1.inc can be enabled for InnoDB and all other
# storage engines, please remove the subtest for Bug#21277 from
# include/index_merge2.inc.
# This test exists already in include/index_merge1.inc.
