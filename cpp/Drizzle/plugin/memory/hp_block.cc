    Consider e.g. a situation where we have one level 1 block and one level 0
    block, the level 0 block is full and this function is called. We only
    need a leaf block in this case. Nevertheless, we will get here with i=1
    and will also allocate sizeof(HP_PTRS) for non-leaf block and will never
    use this space.
    This doesn't add much overhead - with current values of sizeof(HP_PTRS)
    and my_default_record_cache_size we get about 1/128 unused memory.
