/*
  Write a hash-key to the hash-index
  SYNOPSIS
    info     Heap table info
    keyinfo  Key info
    record   Table record to added
    recpos   Memory buffer where the table record will be stored if added
             successfully
  NOTE
    Hash index uses HP_BLOCK structure as a 'growable array' of HASH_INFO
    structs. Array size == number of entries in hash index.
    hp_mask(hp_rec_hashnr()) maps hash entries values to hash array positions.
    If there are several hash entries with the same hash array position P,
    they are connected in a linked list via HASH_INFO::next_key. The first
    list element is located at position P, next elements are located at
    positions for which there is no record that should be located at that
    position. The order of elements in the list is arbitrary.

  RETURN
    0  - OK
    -1 - Out of memory
    HA_ERR_FOUND_DUPP_KEY - Duplicate record on unique key. The record was
    still added and the caller must call hp_delete_key for it.
