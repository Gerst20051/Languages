      Pulled the BLOB alias support out of the  daemon. This was done because
      supporting it in a transactional environment would have been complicated and
      since it is not part of the core objectives of the PBMS daemon I felt that it was
      not worth the effort it would take.

  111 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-08-07
      I cannot be too fussy about reporting bad blob references in checkBlob() because
      of the way the temp log gets reread when the server starts up.

      THis version works with PBMS enabled innoDB.

   93 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-07-21
      This commit contains a lot of changes that touch almost everything. The main changes are:
      
      - Making the PBMS engine transactional. 
      - Simplifying the API used by supporting engines to reference and dereference BLOBs.
      - Added support for an engine level backup of BLOB data.
      
      The code being committed here is NOT stable and still needs a lot of testing.

   92 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-07-03
      Added dynamic circular transaction log and caching code. 

   91 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-05-29
      This commit contains a lot of changes, some of them minor like adding my name to the 
      headers in the files and other more major changes such as:
      
      - All code has been removed that was used to support callbacks from PBMS up into the 
      registered engines. This was used to support the feature that allowed users to access 
      the records in which BLOBs were stored via the HTTP server. This feature is no longer supported 
      and so the code was removed. The removal of this code greatly simplified the interface between
      PBMS and supporting engines and as a result the engine interface was also changed.
      
      - The BLOB URLs stored in tables no longer contain the database name but instead contain
      a database ID. This simplifies support for backup recovery and possible database renaming.
      
      - Support has been added for backup and recovery of teh BLOB repository using standard mysqldump.

   90 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-04-19

      New files required for the cload version of PBMS.

   88 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-03-31
      Converted the pbms client lib over to use lubcurl.
      This is a demo version in which the PBMS engine  transfers the BLOB data directly to S3 storage
      and client request for BLOBs receive a resirect to S3. The redirect is handled with in the client
      API so that it is transparent to the caller.

   87 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-03-25
      The first steps in makeing a version that stores BLOBs in Amazon S3 storage. (Doesn't build yet).

      HTTP headers that are to be saved as BLOB meta data.

   67 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-01-13
      Meta data is now collected by the HTTP server when BLOBs are received.
      When BLOBs are moved from one database to another the entire header including
      meta data is also copied.

   66 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-01-08
      Added Insert, Update, and Delete support for the meta data table.

   65 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2009-01-06

      tables have been added.

   63 Barry.Leslie@PrimeBase.com	2008-12-30
      This is a temporary commit which I expect to uncommit later. It is

       I have simplified the configuration. You now only need to supply
      the path to the MySQL source and then the project will be configured using the 
      same settings as the MySQL build. This includeis compiler settings. If --with-debug 
      is not specified then the build defaults to that used for the MySQL build.

   37 barry_leslie	2008-08-25
      libtool added a /.lib onto the lib path even though I had included it in the path. I have now removed it from my path so libtool is happy.
