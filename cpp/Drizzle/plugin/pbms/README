Media Streaming for MySQL
========================

Media Streaming for MySQL (PBMS) provides the infrastructure for streaming BLOB data directly in and out of a MySQL table. The PBMS daemon is "pluggable", which means that it can be loaded dynamically by MySQL at runtime.

PBMS provides a server-side "streaming API". When this API is supported by a MySQL storage engine, then the engine is said to be "streaming enabled". Any tables created by a streaming enabled engine are referred to as streaming enabled tables. The BLOB data stored in streaming enabled tables can be uploaded and downloaded using HTTP.

For this purpose, the PBMS daemon includes a lightweight HTTP server. The port of the Media Streaming daemon can be specified by setting "pbms_port" system variable on the mysqld command line. By default the port is 8080.

Please refer to the documentation for more details and examples of how to use the Media Streaming daemon:

http://www.blobstreaming.org/documentation

This package includes the complete source code for the daemon. Although this is a standalone project it must be built against a compiled version of the MySQL 5.1 source tree, because it references headers files used internally by the server.

How to build and install the daemon is described in the INSTALL file.

Bug reports, questions and comments can be sent directly to me.

Thanks for your support!
