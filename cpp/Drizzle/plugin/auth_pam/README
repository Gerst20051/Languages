Hi!

First, as experimental goes, this is pretty experimental.

Next thing, I do not really know PAM. What I do know is how to read man
pages :)

Go place this:
auth       required     pam_unix.so
account    required     pam_unix.so

Into a file located here:
/etc/pam.d/drizzle

Please send email to the drizzle mailing list on Launchpad if you would like
to contribute.

Cheers,
    -Brian
