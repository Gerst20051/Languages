# Testcase for BUG#4551
# The bug was that when the table was TEMPORARY, it was not deleted if
# the CREATE SELECT failed (the code intended too, but it actually
# didn't). And as the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE was not written to the
# binlog if it was a transactional table, it resulted in an
# inconsistency between binlog and the internal list of temp tables.
