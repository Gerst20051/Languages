# This test is executed twice for each test case if mysql-test-run is passed
# the flag --check-testcase.
# Before every testcase it's run with mysqltest in record mode and will
# thus produce an output file
# that can be compared to output from after the tescase.
# In that way it's possible to check that a testcase does not have
# any unwanted side affects.
