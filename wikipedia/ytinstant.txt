Aboukhadijeh was offered a job from [[YouTube]] CEO [[Chad Hurley]] shortly after he created the site.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted by John 10:10 AM (CST) |url=http://www.hardocp.com/news/2010/09/12/youtube_maps_instant/ |title=[H&#93;ard&#124;OCP - Youtube and Maps Instant |publisher=Hardocp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=September 10, 2010 | Matthew Lynley |url=http://venturebeat.com/2010/09/10/youtube-instant-job/ |title=Stanford student creates YouTube Instant, gets job offer from YouTube CEO |publisher=VentureBeat |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=September 10, 2010 | Matthew Lynley |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/tecnologia/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=435953 |title= Instant student creates YouTube and contacted via Twitter to work on the video site |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5635570/college-kid-makes-youtube-instant-gets-instant-youtube-job-offer/ |title=College Kid Makes 'YouTube Instant,' Gets Instant YouTube Job Offer |publisher=Gawker.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> 
At the point of YouTube Instant's creation, Aboukhadijeh was a summer intern at [[Facebook]],<ref name="dmwmedia1"/> and has said that he is working on a secret Facebook project.<ref name="webpronews1"/>

==Origins==

The launch of YouTube Instant was announced by Aboukhadijeh on [[Y Combinator]]’s Hacker News feed, which is a news aggregation site that is similar to [[Digg]] and [[Reddit]]. It is modelled after [[Google Instant]] — as a user types in the video they are looking for, "the engine guesses the video and begins playing it immediately."

The project started off as a bet with his college roommate. Aboukhadijeh was quoted as saying, "It started out as a bet with my roommate, Jake Becker. I bet him I could build real-time YouTube search in less than an hour." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/instant-fame-how-to-get-a-job--without-even-searching-20100913-157in.html |title=Instant fame: how to get a job ... without even searching |publisher= Sydney Morning Herald |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Aboukhadijeh lost the bet, for it took him three hours to complete the site, and another couple hours to polish it. Aboukhadijeh said he found it "surprisingly easy to build".

Aboukhadijeh built the site by using the [[YouTube]] API. He scraped [[YouTube]] search suggestions because [[Google]] blocked his server for making far too many repeated requests to the search suggestion endpoint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weeble.net/google-instant-search/576/ |title=Google Instant Search to be Introduced on New Sites by Third-Party Mashups |publisher= Weeble |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> Aboukhadijeh had to re-write the site to instead query [[YouTube]] directly for search suggestions, "eliminating the round-trip to [his] server", in order to address the problem.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20016172-93.html |title='YouTube Instant' creator finds instant fame |publisher= cnet news |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

==Description==

The YouTube Instant interface, which looks similar to the [[YouTube]] front page consists of a box designed for a user to type in his search letter or phrase.  As each letter of the search phrase is typed in, the server goes out into "YouTube video land" and tries to find who it is you might be searching for.  "For instance, when "Bon" was typed in, it instantly brought up Bon Jovi and started to play "Living on a Prayer" on the video screen instantly.  It also had other various video selections from the same group."<ref name="helium1"/>

YouTube Instant is essentially a free utility that strips down the normal YouTube interface to easily include a search bar, as well as a single and central video display as well as five smaller displays below it to present the top five searches based on the user's input. As the user types in text into the search bar, Youtube Instant instantly identifies a best match and, after a short pause to confirm that the user is happy with the match, plays the video in the central display. Beneath this, users are also presented with a smaller version of the file that is being played with a simple play and pause function as well as four other strong matches that the user can opt to select and play in the central panel instead.<ref name="helium2">{{cite web|author=September 10, 2010 Brenna Ehrlich View Comments |url=http://www.helium.com/items/1953961-what-is-you-tube-instant |title=What is YouTube Instant? |publisher=Computers & Technology: Internet |date=2010-08-29 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>

YouTube Instant, as Aboukhadijeh said, would be most useful when one is "looking for a serendipitous video browsing experience".<ref name="alootechie1">{{cite web|author=September 10, 2010 Brenna Ehrlich View Comments |url=http://alootechie.com/content/stanford-student-launches-youtube-instant |title=Stanford student launches YouTube Instant |publisher=Computers & Technology: Internet |date=2010-08-29 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> In comparison with Google Instant, it might not be as useful if "you know exactly what you’re looking for, since you’re shown distracting YouTube videos on the way to your destination", said Aboukhadijeh.<ref name="alootechie1"/> He continues by saying that he thinks this is perfect for many internet users.”<ref name="alootechie1"/>

YouTube Instant presents itself as a "streamlined, neatly presented microcosm" <ref name="helium2"/> of the YouTube universe, which provides a simple and effective means of finding and playing a specific file. Like Google Instant, as soon as the user starts typing into the search bar, the utility looks for matches, and presents a file name to the right of the bar (in a distinctive and quite stylish script), which changes as you continue to type, predicting the best fit based on your input. It is virtually ‘instant’, as the name would suggest, and greatly reduces the time taken to find a file compared to the full version of YouTube.<ref name="helium2"/>

==Limitations==
Youtube Instant possesses very little of the functionality offered by [[YouTube]].<ref name="helium2"/> Both the name of the file and the user name of the individual that uploaded it are not shown to the user. Also, there are no account-based features either, so the user cannot, for example, log in to his existing YouTube account and add a file to his favorites.<ref name="helium2"/>

==Public Response==
Aboukhadijeh was quoted as saying "there was craziness,"  describing the response<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5635570/college-kid-makes-youtube-instant-gets-instant-youtube-job-offer |title=College Kid Makes 'YouTube Instant,' Gets Instant YouTube Job Offer |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2010/09/10/10venturebeat-stanford-student-creates-youtube-instant-get-38618.html?ref=technology |title=Stanford Student Creates YouTube Instant, Gets Job Offer From YouTube CEO |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2010/09/standford_student_gets_instant.html |title=Top Technology News: Stanford student gets instant fame with YouTube Instant |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.stanfordreview.org/2010/09/10/youtube-instant-developed-by-stanford-junior/?ref=nf|title=YouTube Instant Developed by Stanford Junior

And by "craziness," Aboukhadijeh referred to the viral whirlwind<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futuretense.publicradio.org/blog/index.php?id=1097688532 |title=Youtube Instant |date= |accessdate=2010-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnet.com/news-analysis/technology/youtube-instant-creator-finds-instant/74925 |title='YouTube Instant' creator finds instant fame

Within six days, YouTube Instant had seen 715,000 visitors.<ref name="webpronews1"/> There was news coverage by media outlets
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvGMw7HvYQ4&feature=autofb |title=AddTV: Student creates YouTube Instant |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>
such as the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', and ''[[Washington Post]]''. Perhaps one of the puzzles of the buzz that YouTube Instant has created is how YouTube Instant went viral. "I think after things cool down a bit, I should carefully consider how exactly YouTube Instant went viral and write up a blog post to share my thoughts about it all," Aboukhadijeh has said.<ref name="webpronews1"/>

Apart from the obvious achievement of its developer, and the gimmicky allure of the product, there is speculation that it is difficult to predict the longevity of Youtube Instant as it now stands<ref name="helium2"/>. Whereas Google Instant takes an existing product and enhances the user experience without losing any of the other functionality, Youtube Instant offers one new functional away from the main site. As a result, regular users will find this of limited appeal, especially when they find a file that they enjoy. Users will have then to revert to the normal YouTube site to add it to a playlist. It has been speculated that YouTube will eventually incorporate something similar to YouTube Instant into the parent site, which would effectively make Aboukhadijeh’s achievement redundant.<ref name="helium2"/>

==Aboukhadijeh-Hurley Meeting==

Most notable was the job offer from YouTube CEO [[Chad Hurley]] via Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|author=Twitter |url=http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2010/09/standford_student_gets_instant.html |title=Top Technology News: Stanford student gets instant fame with YouTube Instant |publisher=NJ.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> "Want a Job?" Hurley asked, to which Aboukhadijeh, who uses the Twitter handle FreeTheFeross,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://venturebeat.com/2010/09/10/youtube-instant-job/|title=Stanford student creates YouTube Instant, gets job offer from YouTube CEO  |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> replied, "Is that a for-real offer?" Hurley then asked if Aboukhadijeh was "ready to leave school."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feross.org/ |title=Feross.org  |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> A meeting between Aboukhadijeh and Chad Hurley at YouTube's San Bruno, California, headquarters was scheduled for September 13, 2010.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> But the question about whether he would accept the YouTube job still remains an open one. Aboukhadijeh stated "I haven't actually accepted the YouTube offer yet. We're still figuring out how this is all going to work out, and nothing's final yet. However, Chad and the engineers I spoke with were excited about the possibilities."<ref name="webpronews1"/> MediaMemo however claims that Aboukhadijeh "can't go work for Chad Hurley, because he’s already working for Mark Zuckerberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20100911/youtube-instant-dude-cant-go-to-work-for-chad-hurley-because-hes-already-working-for-mark-zuckerberg/ |title=“YouTube Instant” Dude Can’t Go to Work for Chad Hurley, Because He’s Already Working for Mark Zuckerberg|date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Aboukhadijeh disagrees with this claim and by tells CNN that he doesn't see how working at Facebook over summer would "prohibit his taking a job at YouTube".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.hu/2010/TECH/web/09/14/cnet.youtube.instant.creator/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title='YouTube Instant' creator, 19, finds instant fame |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>

==Spin-offs==
There was suddenly a rush to develop an ‘Instant’ version of every popular online brand. Shortly after the creation of YouTube Instant came the creation of [[Google Maps Instant]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5635609/youtube-instant-and-google-maps-instant-follow-in-google-instants-footsteps |title=YouTube Instant and Google Maps Instant Follow in Google Instant's Footsteps |publisher=Lifehacker.com |date=2010-09-11 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> iTunes Instant,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1689432/itunes-the-latest-app-to-go-instant-thanks-to-amateur-hackers |title=iTunes Goes Instant, Thanks to 15-Year-Old |publisher= Fast Company |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> [[Instant Dictionary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Instantionary.com |title=Instantly look up definitions & word meanings! |publisher=Instantionary.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> [[Instant PubMed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.PMinstant.com |title=Search PubMed Instantly! |publisher=PMinstant.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref>, [[OurUse.com]]<ref>[http://www.ouruse.com/ "Instant Video Player with web Image and News Result]</ref> [[WikInstant.com]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.WikInstant.com |title=Search Wikipedia Instantly! |publisher=WikInstant.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref>[[Instant Wikipedia (theinstantwiki.com)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theinstantwiki.com |title=Search Wikipedia as you type! |publisher=The Instant Wiki |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref>  In particular, it was Michael Hart<ref name="mashable1">{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/09/11/google-maps-images-instant/ |title=Google Maps and Images Get the (Unofficial) Instant Treatment|publisher= Fast Company |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> who put Google Images Instant together in less than two hours. He accompanied both apps with a notice that says: “Btw, Google: I’m looking for a job too! Congrats Feross Aboukhadijeh!”, a direct reference to YouTube Co-Founder and CEO Chad Hurley’s public job offer to the guy behind YouTube Instant. He has not received a tweet from Hurley yet.<ref name="mashable1"/> It was Scottish engineer Tam Denholm who decided to wrap another layer around the concept of "instantization" by creating a mashup of these mashups called "Instantise," "which slaps all instant-based Web activity onto a single landing page for easier discovery and use."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369030,00.asp |title='Instantise' Combines Most Popular 'Instant' Search Spin-offs |publisher= PCMAG |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

One of the best known spin-offs is [http://ListAndPlay.com ListAndPlay.com].  It continues where YTinstant stops. The site is being featured as well on major news sites.<ref>http://www.geek.com/articles/news/listandplay-an-awesome-youtube-instant-spin-off-that-lets-you-create-and-share-video-playlists-20100921/</ref><ref>http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/24/youtube-innovations-prove-beneficial-for-developers/</ref><ref>http://newteevee.com/2010/09/22/generate-youtube-playlists-on-the-fly-with-listandplay-com/</ref><ref>http://news.softpedia.com/news/ListAndPlay-Another-Google-Instant-Spin-Off-Simplifies-YouTube-Playlist-Creation-157981.shtml</ref><ref>http://www.socialtimes.com/2010/09/youtube-instant-playlists/</ref> It is developed by Jonathan Bouman, took five days to create and is powered by the [[JQuery|JQuery javascript library]].

The site uses the same instant search technology and runs entirely from the browser side to avoid any scalability problems. The short urls are being generated by using [[URL shortening|bit.ly]]. Users report the site also works on the latest generation [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphones.<ref>http://twitter.com/simbeckhampson/statuses/25416716833</ref>
