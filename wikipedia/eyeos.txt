'''eyeOS''' is an [[open source]] [[web desktop]] following the [[cloud computing]] concept that seeks to enable collaboration and communication among users. It is mainly written in [[PHP]], [[XML]], and [[JavaScript]]. It acts as a platform for web applications written using the eyeOS Toolkit. It includes a Desktop environment with 67 applications and system utilities.<ref>[https://eyeos.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/eyeos/eyeOS/trunk/eyeOS/apps/ eyeOS default applications from project's official SVN server]</ref> It is accessible by portable devices via its mobile front end.<ref>[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/eyeos/+spec/mobile-access Blueprint: “Mobile Access”<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== History ==
The first publicly available eyeOS version was released on August 1, 2005 as eyeOS 0.6.0 in [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]). At the time, it greatly participated in creating the definition of a [[web operating system]] and acted as a concept. Quickly, a worldwide community of developers took part in the project and helped improve it by translating, testing and developing it.

After two years of development, the eyeOS Team published eyeOS 1.0<ref>[http://news.softpedia.com/news/eyeOS-1-0-Dahlia-Available-Now-56380.shtml Softpedia talks about eyeOS 1.0 release]</ref> (on June 4, 2007). Compared with previous versions, eyeOS 1.0 introduced a complete reorganization of the code and some new web technologies, like eyeSoft, a [[Portage (software)|portage]]-based web software installation system. Moreover, eyeOS also included the eyeOS Toolkit, a set of libraries allowing easy and fast development of new web Applications.<ref>[http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/eyeos_10_launches.php eyeOS 1.0 launches - ReadWriteWeb]</ref>

With the release of eyeOS 1.1 on July 2, 2007, eyeOS changed its license and migrated from GNU [[GNU General Public License#Version 2|GPL Version 2]] to [[GNU General Public License#Version 3|Version 3]].

Version 1.2 was released just a few months after the 1.1 version and integrated full compatibility with [[Microsoft Word]] files.

eyeOS 1.5 Gala was released on January 15, 2008.  This version is the first to support both [[Microsoft Office]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] file formats for documents, presentations and spreadsheets. It also has the ability to import and export documents in both formats using server side scripting.<ref>[http://blog.eyeos.org/2008/01/15/eyeos-15-released-eyeos-professional-services-available eyeOS 1.5 Released | eyeOS Professional Services available<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

eyeOS 1.6 was released on April 25, 2008 and included many improvements such as synchronization with local computers, drag and drop, a mobile version and more.<ref>[http://blog.eyeos.org/2008/03/19/whats-coming-in-eyeos-16/ What's coming in eyeOS 1.6 - eyeOS Blog]</ref>

eyeOS 1.8 Lars was released on January 7, 2009 and featured a completely rewritten file manager and a new sound API to develop media rich applications. Later, on April 1, 2009 1.8.5 was released with a new default theme and some rewritten apps such as the Word Processor or the Address Book. On July 13, 2009 1.8.6 was released with an interface for the [[iPhone]] and a new version of eyeMail with support for POP3 and IMAP.

== Structure and API ==
For developers, eyeOS provides the eyeOS Toolkit, a set of libraries and functions to develop applications for eyeOS. Using the integrated [[Portage (software)|Portage]]-based eyeSoft system, one can create their own repository for eyeOS and distribute applications through it.<ref>[http://www.linux.com/feature/118113 eyeOS - a Genuine Web OS by Linux.com]</ref>

Each core part of the desktop is its own application, using javascript to send server commands as the user interacts. As actions are performed using ajax (such as launching an application), it sends event information to the server. The server then sends back tasks for the client to do in XML format, such as drawing a widget.<ref>[http://dev.eyeos.org eyeOS Developers Community]</ref>

On the server, eyeOS uses [[XML]] files to store information. This makes it simple for a user to set up on the server, as it requires zero configuration other than the account information for the first user, making it simple to deploy. To avoid bottlenecks that flat files present, each user's information and settings are stored in different files, preventing [[resource starvation]] from occurring.
